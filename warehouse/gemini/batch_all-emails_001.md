Good morning Mary, 

 

Tower has provided the needed quotes for rental and purchase.

 

Now the client needs 2 more bids from 2 other vendors for a total of 3 Vendors for rental and purchase, each. 

 

In each bid, I'd like to see:

*                Cost to lease (including all service/maintenance)

*                Cost to buy outright + the cost to service/maintain the compactor

Hey Dawn, 

 

I submitted a request through the portal for bids. However, we already received quotes from Tower. Is the "Compactor Rentals Of America" one Vendor or multiple vendors? As I have to collect 2 more bids for purchase and rental from 2 other companies, aside from Tower.

Did you request quotes via the portal?  From what I understand, you should be able to obtain quotes from multiple suppliers.  I believe the two typically used are CRA and Tower.

Hello,

 

Apologies for the delayed response on this matter.  We were awaiting Republic’s response on any costs associated with removing their equipment, which was finally provided.

 

While our records show that the agreement is still active for Jones Grant, Republic Services is indicating that they now have it on a month-to-month status.  Therefore, if the property wishes to cancel, there would be no liquidated damages involved.

 

You are currently paying $883.35 per compactor for the rental to Republic.  To remove the existing compactor equipment, there would be a $1,540.00 charge, per unit, to uninstall the compactors.  Once requested, it typically takes 15-20 days to schedule the removal.

 

Greystar would handle procuring the replacement equipment through their preferred equipment vendors, CRA and Tower. 

 

You could either continue to utilize Republic to service the replacement equipment, or potentially switch to an alternate vendor.  Below are quotes from both WM and an alternate third party vendor for review.  Note, quotes are for service only; If the property were to lease that equipment, the lease cost would likely be able to be added to the consolidated invoice/ WM would be able to pay the lease cost on behalf of the property.

 

Current: Republic Services

$265.00/haul

$88.34 disposal/ton

 

Bid #1: Waste Management

$227.08/haul

$43.05 disposal/ton (3 ton minimum)

 

Bid #2: GFL

$257.40/haul

$71.50 disposal/ton (3 ton minimum)

 

Quotes are valid for 30 days.  Rates are per compactor, and do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

I have attached the information again on how to access the Waste Portal for equipment quotes, if needed.

 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

 

Thank you,

Awesome. 

PO number or anything I need to include on invoice for your internal processes? Or just send?

And what’s best place to send (I think I have done your email in the past, but can specify a billing email as well if convenient).

	Hi Richard - 

	I was reviewing the executed SOW from our first engagement, and I believe that we're still "good" to continue under that contract if good with you. 
	
	The terms are T&M (per hour) of $185/hr - and I'm estimating around 15-20 hours to get it pixel perfect, likely fewer. With Luisana on the job, will be top-notch quality. I have had her focusing on our website rebrand, but she'll have capacity starting as soon as the next few days to get things started. 
	
	We can do a "prepaid" sort of model where I can invoice you for 15-20 hours (your choice on how many) in Dec for you to have the funds fall in 2025, but the hours can remain active and available until they are consumed (no expiration). 

	If this sounds good, LMK and I can issue an invoice - just share any PO number that I may need to add to get things moving and we'll be good to go.

		Hi - sorry behind here - 
		
		Here's the demo I just sent to you over text - just what I'm thinking about so far: https://music-foil-61261376.figma.site <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://clk.shadowrock.io/b?y=49q24eh268qj4cj56gqm2p9k6crj2cb4coom4p3264sjie3170p68e31coh2o8ji48t24q3keho76ehf5tmnasr9ccmmcrr9dgmjcc9i6ooj6dpm5pj6iprdc4n76qbkckni4===__;!!JD2t4ugY8Q!kA6YE-R5ktUrSRrdHYvZoeGcd6UTTQLh8wmum3mTAyaeOYXlUZ2Kkn4CLQ9ZUhgAk2JxSgImsmsC6VEC7AJcBA$> 
		
		If you click on either of the first two tiles in the grid, you'll arrive at identical Formstack Forms which are embedded on the site and styled roughly according to the Greystar styling. 
		
		This is what I was referencing with the "figma up front, formstack in back" architecture on our call.

			Maybe I can get us to a jump off point.  I have some of the suppliers on the current form page will not be needed and I need to add some so i'll try to spin up a starting point and then we can let Lousiana work her magic.
			Also get me the quote so I can just get a sign off on my side.  So we can get going.  I've already gotten sign on so it should be quick.  We can go ahead and get started.

Hi Richard - 

I was reviewing the executed SOW from our first engagement, and I believe that we're still "good" to continue under that contract if good with you. 

The terms are T&M (per hour) of $185/hr - and I'm estimating around 15-20 hours to get it pixel perfect, likely fewer. With Luisana on the job, will be top-notch quality. I have had her focusing on our website rebrand, but she'll have capacity starting as soon as the next few days to get things started. 

We can do a "prepaid" sort of model where I can invoice you for 15-20 hours (your choice on how many) in Dec for you to have the funds fall in 2025, but the hours can remain active and available until they are consumed (no expiration). 

If this sounds good, LMK and I can issue an invoice - just share any PO number that I may need to add to get things moving and we'll be good to go.

	Do we want to schedule a quick call to regroup?  I'm hoping to have this live in  1 - 2 weeks at the longest.
