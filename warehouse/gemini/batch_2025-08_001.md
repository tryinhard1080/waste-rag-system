## Email Content

Thanks Ian.  Thats all I needed.  This one just kind of stood out so I wanted to check in.   We've also had a few of these popping up where we aren't giving WM 30 days so they are a little on edge too because its hard for them to move that fast. 

WM will move as quickly as they can to make things happen and get the compactor removed but labor is tough to nail down and really expensive so it might take a week or two.  Rebekah is doing her best.

Good afternoon Richard,

We unfortunately received a 1 day notice from our client that the property was sold to the University of Louisville, and that our given direction was to provide notice to any and all contracts with the asset and that none were being assumed by the university.

It certainly is out of the norm, but we appreciate your assistance in the matter.

Thank you,

Hi Marah,
Quick Questions -  This transition feels a bit different than usual, with pulling equipment on such short notice and not sharing the new client so WM has an opportunity to maintain the work.  Just wanted to see if I could get a few details to help me make sense of this one.

Hi Rebekah,

 

Yes, I can write you up a 30-day notice. Everything will need to be removed from the property as it is not transferring over to anyone at this time.

 

Effective date will be August 31st however we just want billed for the next 30 days and everything removed immediately. I am reaching out as I am working with the transitions team on this. 

 

I have copied Melissa on this email for visibility. She is with the transitions team.

Hi Marah,

 

We are supposed to receive a 30-day notice.

 

Are you wanting to actually terminate the services?  If so, I will have to get a quote for removing the compactor that will be billed to Greystar.  If not, I need a contact for the new owner/manager.

 

I need to know the effective date of the change and it will be processed when we receive the official Notice of Termination from Greystar’s Property Transitions team.

Hello Darian, TGIF!

 

Under the modified service levels with 5x Week on all services, annual expense would be $26,010.72, before any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Below is the monthly breakdown:

 

Modified Service Levels $2,167.56/Month

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 5x Week $1,450.56/month

*	$1,150.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

Trash (1) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $292.00

Single Stream RECY (2) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $425.00

 

We cannot exempt your property from overages, the goal would be for your property to have the appropriate amount of services.   Please keep in mind that drivers may refuse to service if the compactor bins are overloaded to the point where the side doors won’t close or the bins are too heavy due to the weight (since the bins can hold 3x the amount of material since it’s compacted).  If that occurs, staff would need to assist with removing the overflow and a service change would be required if the issue became a reoccurring concern. 

 

Having said that, at this time we are not charging overages for the compactor service, which would continue under the reduced schedule.  WM reserves the right to change this practice at any time, especially if overloaded bins become a common occurrence with no changes made to resolve the matter.

Hi Dawn,

 

Thank you! And what would the annual expense be with 5day pickups? We are worried that if we switch to 4 days, we’re going to get hit with overage charges. Can Waste Management agree to not charge us overages?

Hello Darian, 

 

Apologies for the delayed response.  I was waiting for a few different numbers for the compactor service, because I was trying to get some options based on what the property was offered by SBC Waste Solutions.

 

Currently, the property is leasing a machine and 3-2yd trash compactor boxes that connect to the machine.  The quote that SBC provided was for 3-1.5yd compactor boxes at $799.00/month (plus lease).

 

I confirmed that we could replace the existing 2yd boxes with 1.5yd boxes.  Nevertheless, it could take a few weeks to source the boxes and then modify them to work with the machine that is installed.  The modification cost would be absorbed in the overall lease, which would not change.  However, we would recommend, instead, that the property keep the existing 2yd boxes, and just adjust the schedule slightly lower.  3-1.5yd boxes 5x week is about 202.50 yds/week (compactors are 3:1 ratio, so a 1.5yd compactor box equals 4.50yds/box).  It would be 216 yds/week for 3-2yd boxes 4x week.  So the property would be disposing of around the same amount of trash and would not need to switch out the existing boxes for somewhat smaller ones.

 

Here are the current rates, and then quotes for various options.  I did get a quote for 5x Week as well on the existing 2yd:    

 

Current

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 7x Week $2,621.84/month

*	$2,321.28 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

 

Proposed

Option #1: Trash (3) 1.5 Yard Compactors 5x Week* $1,135.56/month

*	$835.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	202.50 yds/wk (3 boxes x 13.50yds (1.5yd x 3 = 4.5yd/box) x 5 pickups/week)

 

Option #2: Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 4x Week* $1,236.56/month

*	$936.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	216 yds/wk (3 boxes x 18yds (2yd x 3 = 6yd/box) x 4 pickups/week)

 

Option #3: Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 5x Week* $1,450.56/month

*	$1,150.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	270 yds/wk (3 boxes x 18yds (2yd x 3 = 6yd/box) x 5 pickups/week)

 

Note, to remove the compactor equipment entirely (if the property were to cancel WM service) it would be $1500-$1700.  There would also be a $75 removal/per container for the remaining trash/recycle dumpsters.  Quotes do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you wanted to proceed with one of the options above.

Hello Richard,

Thanks for the response.

Greystar Construction can’t sign another vendors purchase agreement.

If your supplier will sign our PO, we can move forward.

If not, Greystar is going another direction.

Please advise.

HI Manhel,

I'm just jumping in here since Jeff is out, but we can get you an agreement very quickly.  We just need to get your request in.  Click this link below -  it will take you straight to a very basic request form where you can advise who our supplier partners need to connect with at the property.  You can select both Tower and CRA if you want two different bids.  The suppliers will reach out to you, or the contact provided very quickly and can provide a quote or agreement very expeditiously (usually within a few days).  If they need a site survey completed (can sometimes be avoided if you can provide them with pictures) they might need a bit longer to give you a contract to execute once they verify electrical and current dimensions.  Both our rental companies offer 45 day install guarantees from the date of signature on the agreement.  Rough MATH HERE... I'm thinking its around $675 for the apartment style compactor and 5 bins if everything is standard sized and 3 phase electrical.    The pricing is good but you do need to get a formal quote.  

 

https://greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal - This link is safe and how you initiate getting compactor bids from our suppliers.  Its an internal resource.  Both the suppliers are vetted national recommended supplier partners.

Hello,

I understand but I can’t wait that long to buy out this scope.

Are you saying we can’t execute an agreement until we get closer to that date?
If that is the case, I need to go another direction/vendor.

Hello Darian, TGIF!

 

Under the modified service levels with 5x Week on all services, annual expense would be $26,010.72, before any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Below is the monthly breakdown:

 

Modified Service Levels $2,167.56/Month

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 5x Week $1,450.56/month

*	$1,150.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

Trash (1) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $292.00

Single Stream RECY (2) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $425.00

 

We cannot exempt your property from overages, the goal would be for your property to have the appropriate amount of services.   Please keep in mind that drivers may refuse to service if the compactor bins are overloaded to the point where the side doors won’t close or the bins are too heavy due to the weight (since the bins can hold 3x the amount of material since it’s compacted).  If that occurs, staff would need to assist with removing the overflow and a service change would be required if the issue became a reoccurring concern. 

 

Having said that, at this time we are not charging overages for the compactor service, which would continue under the reduced schedule.  WM reserves the right to change this practice at any time, especially if overloaded bins become a common occurrence with no changes made to resolve the matter.

Hi Dawn,

 

Thank you! And what would the annual expense be with 5day pickups? We are worried that if we switch to 4 days, we’re going to get hit with overage charges. Can Waste Management agree to not charge us overages?

Hello Darian,

 

Under the original service levels, annual expense was $56,251.68, before any applicable taxes/fees.

Under the modified service levels, annual expense would be $23,226.72, before any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Below is the monthly breakdown of the original service levels and modified service levels.  The trash 2yd dumpster service has already been decreased, as well as the recycle 2yd dumpster service.

 

Original Service Levels $4,687.64/Mo.

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 7x Week $2,621.84

*	$2,321.28 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

Trash (3) 2 Yard Dumpsters 7x Week $1,214.70

Single Stream RECY (2) 2 Yard Dumpsters 7x Week $851.10

 

Modified Service Levels $1,935.56/Month

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 4x Week $1,236.56

*	$936.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

Trash (1) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $292.00

Single Stream RECY (2) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $425.00

 

Let me know if I should have option #2 implemented on the trash compactor service, and then what pickup days you’d want on the reduced schedule.  Or let me know if you have any questions on the above numbers.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: 1400 Wabash (GRY019289) Notice 

 

Hello Darian, 

 

Apologies for the delayed response.  I was waiting for a few different numbers for the compactor service, because I was trying to get some options based on what the property was offered by SBC Waste Solutions.

 

Currently, the property is leasing a machine and 3-2yd trash compactor boxes that connect to the machine.  The quote that SBC provided was for 3-1.5yd compactor boxes at $799.00/month (plus lease).

 

I confirmed that we could replace the existing 2yd boxes with 1.5yd boxes.  Nevertheless, it could take a few weeks to source the boxes and then modify them to work with the machine that is installed.  The modification cost would be absorbed in the overall lease, which would not change.  However, we would recommend, instead, that the property keep the existing 2yd boxes, and just adjust the schedule slightly lower.  3-1.5yd boxes 5x week is about 202.50 yds/week (compactors are 3:1 ratio, so a 1.5yd compactor box equals 4.50yds/box).  It would be 216 yds/week for 3-2yd boxes 4x week.  So the property would be disposing of around the same amount of trash and would not need to switch out the existing boxes for somewhat smaller ones.

 

Here are the current rates, and then quotes for various options.  I did get a quote for 5x Week as well on the existing 2yd:    

 

Current

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 7x Week $2,621.84/month

*	$2,321.28 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

 

Proposed

Option #1: Trash (3) 1.5 Yard Compactors 5x Week* $1,135.56/month

*	$835.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	202.50 yds/wk (3 boxes x 13.50yds (1.5yd x 3 = 4.5yd/box) x 5 pickups/week)

 

Option #2: Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 4x Week* $1,236.56/month

*	$936.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	216 yds/wk (3 boxes x 18yds (2yd x 3 = 6yd/box) x 4 pickups/week)

 

Option #3: Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 5x Week* $1,450.56/month

*	$1,150.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	270 yds/wk (3 boxes x 18yds (2yd x 3 = 6yd/box) x 5 pickups/week)

 

Note, to remove the compactor equipment entirely (if the property were to cancel WM service) it would be $1500-$1700.  There would also be a $75 removal/per container for the remaining trash/recycle dumpsters.  Quotes do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you wanted to proceed with one of the options above.

 

Thanks,

Hello Darian, TGIF!

 

Under the modified service levels with 5x Week on all services, annual expense would be $26,010.72, before any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Below is the monthly breakdown:

 

Modified Service Levels $2,167.56/Month

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 5x Week $1,450.56/month

*	$1,150.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

Trash (1) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $292.00

Single Stream RECY (2) 2 Yard Dumpsters 5x Week $425.00

 

We cannot exempt your property from overages, the goal would be for your property to have the appropriate amount of services.   Please keep in mind that drivers may refuse to service if the compactor bins are overloaded to the point where the side doors won’t close or the bins are too heavy due to the weight (since the bins can hold 3x the amount of material since it’s compacted).  If that occurs, staff would need to assist with removing the overflow and a service change would be required if the issue became a reoccurring concern. 

 

Having said that, at this time we are not charging overages for the compactor service, which would continue under the reduced schedule.  WM reserves the right to change this practice at any time, especially if overloaded bins become a common occurrence with no changes made to resolve the matter.

Hi Dawn,

 

Thank you! And what would the annual expense be with 5day pickups? We are worried that if we switch to 4 days, we’re going to get hit with overage charges. Can Waste Management agree to not charge us overages?

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 7x Week $2,621.84

Hello Darian, 

 

Apologies for the delayed response.  I was waiting for a few different numbers for the compactor service, because I was trying to get some options based on what the property was offered by SBC Waste Solutions.

 

Currently, the property is leasing a machine and 3-2yd trash compactor boxes that connect to the machine.  The quote that SBC provided was for 3-1.5yd compactor boxes at $799.00/month (plus lease).

 

I confirmed that we could replace the existing 2yd boxes with 1.5yd boxes.  Nevertheless, it could take a few weeks to source the boxes and then modify them to work with the machine that is installed.  The modification cost would be absorbed in the overall lease, which would not change.  However, we would recommend, instead, that the property keep the existing 2yd boxes, and just adjust the schedule slightly lower.  3-1.5yd boxes 5x week is about 202.50 yds/week (compactors are 3:1 ratio, so a 1.5yd compactor box equals 4.50yds/box).  It would be 216 yds/week for 3-2yd boxes 4x week.  So the property would be disposing of around the same amount of trash and would not need to switch out the existing boxes for somewhat smaller ones.

 

Here are the current rates, and then quotes for various options.  I did get a quote for 5x Week as well on the existing 2yd:    

 

Current

Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 7x Week $2,621.84/month

*	$2,321.28 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

 

Proposed

Option #1: Trash (3) 1.5 Yard Compactors 5x Week* $1,135.56/month

*	$835.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	202.50 yds/wk (3 boxes x 13.50yds (1.5yd x 3 = 4.5yd/box) x 5 pickups/week)

 

Option #2: Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 4x Week* $1,236.56/month

*	$936.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	216 yds/wk (3 boxes x 18yds (2yd x 3 = 6yd/box) x 4 pickups/week)

 

Option #3: Trash (3) 2 Yard Compactors 5x Week* $1,450.56/month

*	$1,150.00 Service
*	$300.56 Lease

	*	270 yds/wk (3 boxes x 18yds (2yd x 3 = 6yd/box) x 5 pickups/week)

 

Note, to remove the compactor equipment entirely (if the property were to cancel WM service) it would be $1500-$1700.  There would also be a $75 removal/per container for the remaining trash/recycle dumpsters.  Quotes do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Let me know if you have any questions, or if you wanted to proceed with one of the options above.

Yes, those are the numbers I received. The owners of the building are asking if we can get a better deal if we use a different vendor. $156,167/year is a lot for trash/recycle service.

I think there may be confusion here on the pricing. It appears as though you are calculating a monthly increase as a weekly increase, multiplying the increase by 52, rather than 12.

Hi Rebekah,

Sure, it is simply a pricing concern. I have started looking around for bids. We are looking to increase the frequency of trash and recycle pick ups by one day each and that is adding an additional expense of $23k/year for our client. This is all passed on to residents and we are already passing on huge utility bills to our residents so I am just concerned that Waste Management may not be the best choice for us anymore financially.

Hi Shaina,

 

WM is Greystar’s preferred national partner. I’ve attached the agreements. 

 

Are you having issues? I do not see any issues reported to our customer service department. The last request was for a bulk pickup in March.

Ok, I am so sorry. I presented to the client and they were having a hard time swallowing a $83k/year increase. I think we will keep the compactor pick-ups the same (6x week) and just increase trash and recycling pick-ups by one day each. 

So I have to ask one last favor, can you provide pricing for the following?

Trash 4x/week

Recycle 5x/week

Hello there,

I have submitted the following quote for trash 

2–3-yard trash 5X per week

Reference 88704020

Please allow 2-3 business days to obtain the quote.

Compactor - we are currently at 6X per week @ $982.88, I don't understand why it costs $713.02 to add one day. Is it because Sunday costs extra?

The increase is due to adding an additional 21 yards per week = 84 additional yards per month

I will wait for your approval for the service increases before processing any changes.

Trash - Yes, you had provided the cost for pick up 7 days a week. Since we are currently at 3 days, I am thinking 5 days a week would be meaningful enough to make a difference for us. What is the cost for 5 days a week?

Compactor - we are currently at 6X per week @ $982.88, I don't understand why it costs $713.02 to add one day. Is it because Sunday costs extra?

I will most likely get the recycle increase approved, just hold off until I get all over this approved. 🙂

Trash: $834.86 Can we get a price for 5 days a week? ------

The current trash service is 

2–3-yard dumpster trash 3X per week (MWF) $607.22 are you wanting an additional quote for 5X per week. Is that correct?

Compactor: $713.02 why this much of an increase to add one more day?

Yes, the quote 1-3-yard trash compactor 7X per week (Mon-Sunday) $1695.90 is correct. That would be an additional 21 yards per week

Recycle: $452.36 Yes, we need this!

This is approved to increase, correct?

4-3-yard dumpster single stream recycling 6X per week ( Mon-Tues-Wed-Thursday-Friday-Sat) $1411.84

Please let me know.

Thank you

Hello,

 

WM bills in arrears on the consolidated invoicing, so final invoices will likely be released in September.

 

Removal costs will be $75.00 for the 8yd.

There will be a final haul on the compactor, which would be the normal haul rate of $522.43 plus $99.11/ton with a 3-ton minimum.  Then there will be a $2000 removal fee for uninstalling and removing the powerpack and guiderails.

 

Thanks,

Hi Rebekah,

 

Yes, I can write you up a 30-day notice. Everything will need to be removed from the property as it is not transferring over to anyone at this time.

 

Effective date will be August 31st however we just want billed for the next 30 days and everything removed immediately. I am reaching out as I am working with the transitions team on this.

Hi Marah,

 

We are supposed to receive a 30-day notice.

 

Are you wanting to actually terminate the services?  If so, I will have to get a quote for removing the compactor that will be billed to Greystar.  If not, I need a contact for the new owner/manager.

 

I need to know the effective date of the change and it will be processed when we receive the official Notice of Termination from Greystar’s Property Transitions team.

Hi- I was hoping someone can assist us. Arlo Buffalo Heights had an extension for the sale to 8/15. This was updated in Salesforce, so WM was also aware via our National alerts. 

The service was terminated as of yesterday we were told. Our trash dumpsters are full and need to ensure we service the asset asap and continue service through 8/15.

Ahh Gotcha.   The PO isn't the problem.  Any rental will come with a solid 3 or 5 year contract that needs to be signed.  I can get you a purchase completed on a really basic proposal.   In the past the agreement we've received from construction (its lengthy)  we couldn't find any suppliers willing to sign.  I dont want to assume they are all the same.  The biggest challenge is when the agreement we are asking to use applies this universal indemnification that says the client is fully released from anything surrounding the compactor usage etc.  No of the suppliers we've found are willing to take that kind of liability.  They have no way to control how anyone at the property uses the equipment or how residents use the equipment.

Does the agreement you need to get signed have those same terms?

Hello Richard,

Thanks for the response.

Greystar Construction can’t sign another vendors purchase agreement.

If your supplier will sign our PO, we can move forward.

If not, Greystar is going another direction.

Please advise.

HI Manhel,

I'm just jumping in here since Jeff is out, but we can get you an agreement very quickly.  We just need to get your request in.  Click this link below -  it will take you straight to a very basic request form where you can advise who our supplier partners need to connect with at the property.  You can select both Tower and CRA if you want two different bids.  The suppliers will reach out to you, or the contact provided very quickly and can provide a quote or agreement very expeditiously (usually within a few days).  If they need a site survey completed (can sometimes be avoided if you can provide them with pictures) they might need a bit longer to give you a contract to execute once they verify electrical and current dimensions.  Both our rental companies offer 45 day install guarantees from the date of signature on the agreement.  Rough MATH HERE... I'm thinking its around $675 for the apartment style compactor and 5 bins if everything is standard sized and 3 phase electrical.    The pricing is good but you do need to get a formal quote.  

 

https://greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal - This link is safe and how you initiate getting compactor bids from our suppliers.  Its an internal resource.  Both the suppliers are vetted national recommended supplier partners.

Hello,

I understand but I can’t wait that long to buy out this scope.

Are you saying we can’t execute an agreement until we get closer to that date?
If that is the case, I need to go another direction/vendor.

Thanks

Thanks Manhel- with it being that far out, I would not want to even ballpark the cost. The form takes 45 seconds to fill out and select Tower Compactors and Gary will reach out to you within 24hrs. It’s quick and easy.

## Email Content

Thanks Ian.  Thats all I needed.  This one just kind of stood out so I wanted to check in.   We've also had a few of these popping up where we aren't giving WM 30 days so they are a little on edge too because its hard for them to move that fast. 

WM will move as quickly as they can to make things happen and get the compactor removed but labor is tough to nail down and really expensive so it might take a week or two.  Rebekah is doing her best.

Good afternoon Richard,

We unfortunately received a 1 day notice from our client that the property was sold to the University of Louisville, and that our given direction was to provide notice to any and all contracts with the asset and that none were being assumed by the university.

It certainly is out of the norm, but we appreciate your assistance in the matter.

Hi Marah,
Quick Questions -  This transition feels a bit different than usual, with pulling equipment on such short notice and not sharing the new client so WM has an opportunity to maintain the work.  Just wanted to see if I could get a few details to help me make sense of this one.

Hi Rebekah,

 

Yes, I can write you up a 30-day notice. Everything will need to be removed from the property as it is not transferring over to anyone at this time.

 

Effective date will be August 31st however we just want billed for the next 30 days and everything removed immediately. I am reaching out as I am working with the transitions team on this. 

 

I have copied Melissa on this email for visibility. She is with the transitions team. 

 

Thank you

Hi Marah,

 

We are supposed to receive a 30-day notice.

 

Are you wanting to actually terminate the services?  If so, I will have to get a quote for removing the compactor that will be billed to Greystar.  If not, I need a contact for the new owner/manager.

 

I need to know the effective date of the change and it will be processed when we receive the official Notice of Termination from Greystar’s Property Transitions team.

 

Thanks,

Hi- I was hoping someone can assist us. Arlo Buffalo Heights had an extension for the sale to 8/15. This was updated in Salesforce, so WM was also aware via our National alerts. 

 

The service was terminated as of yesterday we were told. Our trash dumpsters are full and need to ensure we service the asset asap and continue service through 8/15.

Hi Angie,

 

The compactor had 7.10 tons in it when it was serviced on the 24th.  It would not have been able to hold 19.88 tons of trash (7.10 tons from the 24th and 12.78 tons from the 17th).  When it was serviced again on 8/12, it had 9.05 tons in it.  It could not have held 16.15 tons in it (9.05 tons from 8/12 and 7.10 tons from the 24th).  All hauls were needed that were performed. 

 

The only “extra costs” associated would have been for the trip charge and that was due to the car blocking the compactor when service was attempted on 7/6.

 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further on Tuesday.

 

Thanks,

Due to the delay on the pickup. We had the compactor being picked up on the 17th and again on the 24th. Charges for the "extra" pick up was $816.57.

Hi Angie,

 

Unfortunately, I am not available this afternoon.  Are you referring to this charge?

 



 

Every time the compactor is hauled, you are charged $185.66 for the haul charge (the truck coming to the property and getting the compactor, taking it to the landfill and bring it back to the property) and $115.01 per ton for the disposal of the waste inside the compactor.  If you have 5 tons in the compactor, it is $115.01x5 for the disposal portion.  If you have 12.78 tons, it is 12.78 tons x $115.01 for the disposal portion.

 

When your service was attempted on 7/6, the compactor area was blocked by a vehicle and the compactor could not be serviced.  The local office was not able to return for service until 7/17.  That does not change the amount of trash (or the weight) of the trash that your property is generating over the month.  It may change “when” you are charged for it.  Regardless of when that tonnage is picked up, you are charged $115.01 per ton (unless there are less than three tons, you are charged for a minimum of 3 tons).

 

If you would like to discuss further, I will be available at 1pm CST on Tuesday, otherwise, I will not be available again until October 22nd.

 

Thanks,

Hi Angie,

 

Your disposal per ton is the same whether you have 5 tons or 13 tons in it, you are charged per ton.  The only time you are charged more is if you have less than 3 tons because there is a 3 ton minimum.

 

Thanks,

Hi Rebekah,

The pick-up on 7/17 was delayed on your end. Had the schedule been maintained, the tonnage might have aligned with the expected rate.

Let me know your thoughts.

Hello,

 

I was made aware you had some questions related to billing and your contract.

 

For the haul on 7/17, we cannot credit it.  Your compactor had 12.78 tons in it, that is at absolute max capacity.  Had we not serviced it, you would have had trash all over the ground and it would have been too heavy to pick up.

 

How can we assist with questions related to your contract?

 

Thanks,

## Email Content

Hi Laurie/Angie- I thought to check in as it’s  not common to have our properties leave the WM National program. Between the competitive pricing, Mighty90s compliance, ability to manage and optimize costs and overall support, we’ve had really good experiences with WM as a whole.  Was the reasoning over this 1 service issue?

 

As an alternative, we can seek out a new hauler if that is of interest instead of a full cancellation? That approach would keep all the benefits of the National program in place but replace WM as the hauler.

 

Thanks for the insight, glad to chat as well!

Hello,

 

If you decide to cancel, we will need a 30 day notice.  It will be $75 per container to remove the recycling bins and it will be $185.66 plus $115.01/ton for the removal of the receiver box of the compactor.

 

Thanks,

Hi Angie,

 

The compactor had 7.10 tons in it when it was serviced on the 24th.  It would not have been able to hold 19.88 tons of trash (7.10 tons from the 24th and 12.78 tons from the 17th).  When it was serviced again on 8/12, it had 9.05 tons in it.  It could not have held 16.15 tons in it (9.05 tons from 8/12 and 7.10 tons from the 24th).  All hauls were needed that were performed. 

 

The only “extra costs” associated would have been for the trip charge and that was due to the car blocking the compactor when service was attempted on 7/6.

 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further on Tuesday.

 

Thanks,

Due to the delay on the pickup. We had the compactor being picked up on the 17th and again on the 24th. Charges for the "extra" pick up was $816.57.

Hi Angie,

 

Unfortunately, I am not available this afternoon.  Are you referring to this charge?

 



 

Every time the compactor is hauled, you are charged $185.66 for the haul charge (the truck coming to the property and getting the compactor, taking it to the landfill and bring it back to the property) and $115.01 per ton for the disposal of the waste inside the compactor.  If you have 5 tons in the compactor, it is $115.01x5 for the disposal portion.  If you have 12.78 tons, it is 12.78 tons x $115.01 for the disposal portion.

 

When your service was attempted on 7/6, the compactor area was blocked by a vehicle and the compactor could not be serviced.  The local office was not able to return for service until 7/17.  That does not change the amount of trash (or the weight) of the trash that your property is generating over the month.  It may change “when” you are charged for it.  Regardless of when that tonnage is picked up, you are charged $115.01 per ton (unless there are less than three tons, you are charged for a minimum of 3 tons).

 

If you would like to discuss further, I will be available at 1pm CST on Tuesday, otherwise, I will not be available again until October 22nd.

 

Thanks,

Hi Angie,

 

Your disposal per ton is the same whether you have 5 tons or 13 tons in it, you are charged per ton.  The only time you are charged more is if you have less than 3 tons because there is a 3 ton minimum.

The pick-up on 7/17 was delayed on your end. Had the schedule been maintained, the tonnage might have aligned with the expected rate.

Hello,

 

I was made aware you had some questions related to billing and your contract.

 

For the haul on 7/17, we cannot credit it.  Your compactor had 12.78 tons in it, that is at absolute max capacity.  Had we not serviced it, you would have had trash all over the ground and it would have been too heavy to pick up.

 

How can we assist with questions related to your contract?

Hi Bronte,

 

It is not. It is an error on the Mighty 90s end by coding the trash service under Conservice (non-compliant waste vendor) instead of WM.

Hello Korilynne,

 

Unfortunately, it does not.  Amber has already provided the quote for the compactor service on July 24th, but we cannot quote the recycling service until we know that we can fit a 4yd container in the opening of this area.  The dimensions of the opening of this area is not included in the drawings provided.

	Hi Korilynne,

	 

	We need to confirm that the opening of that area of the enclosure (built for the recycling containers) would be wide enough for the 4yd containers to be wheeled in/out of the area.  The picture of the 8 little squares makes it appear as though that area is being built for carts/toters for recycling.  WM does not provide carts/toter recycling in this area.  We need to make sure that the area will be able to accommodate the recycling bins that we can provide.

	Any chance you would be able to help with the below? My clients are eager to get these expenses added to their budget so they can provide to their partners and bank for loan & funding purposes. Need to know the code for the recycling bins, service and ramp up cost for the lease up of the 240 units that has first building delivered on 9/15 and final 10th building in March.

				Yes and no. We offer cardboard or single stream recycling for front load containers (ex. 4yd or 8yd containers), however the 3rd party we use for 96 gallon cart recycle containers is only accepting new accounts if they require ABC recycle (this would be for a restaurant or bar).

				Hi Amber-

				 

				Sending a recap for the Easton new development. Would you be able to get me a quote by eob tomorrow as I must have this budget to the client Friday?

				 

				1.	Is the compactor a single phase or 3 phase as the agreement states both? 3 Phase
				2.	Also, confirming no Charlotte City fee for waste collection has been paid. That would have been $26k or so at the rate of $110/unit/year. Properties in city limits have an option to have the city provide the service which comes at a premium compared to 3rd party vendors. Confirmed
				3.	Equipment has been purchased by construction. Please see additional details below 😊 

					1.	They have a trash compactor that has been purchased. Install is tracking for when we deliver building 4 (September).
					2.	Specs on what we have ordered is in the attached contract. Also attached is the enclosure plan from our architectural plans. 
					3.	Yes, recycling services are planned and we will have 8 bins.

					1.	Are the recycle bins toters?  Unsure of this. Michael Garfield <mailto:mgarfield@waypointresidential.com>  Craig Chambers <mailto:CChambers@waypointresidential.com>  what have we installed previously on the Florida projects?

				1.	Is the approach to the trash enclosure reinforced concrete to avoid breakdown over time? I believe so, but I’ll defer to Michael Garfield <mailto:mgarfield@waypointresidential.com>  who has better familiarity with the plans.
				2.	Updated delivery schedule below. Hopeful for first move ins to start end of September.

Hi Kimberly,

 

I’ve finally confirmed, the refund will be $3838.65, which includes the deduction of the $108.50 from a short pay from January 2023.

 

If you want to dig into the payment made back in January 2023, I’ve attached the invoice they sent from January 2023.

 

They said they would try to send out the refund by the end of next week.

 

They will 

 

Thanks,

Hi Kimberly,

 

This is what they said:

 

We actually cut the check on April 15th and it was check #15673 and it was mailed to the property.  I just checked the bank, and it has not cleared yet.  I would like to wait a couple more days to see if the check makes it to Alta Porter.  If they do not receive it this week, we will stop payment and issue a new check.

Conex is supposed to be refunding you directly for those over payments.  Do you want to wait to make the transition until you get that refund?

Hello, 

 

Thank you! I'm good with moving forward—let’s go ahead and make the switch to arrow waste. Could you please confirm the pickup days so I can update my maintenance team?

 

Also, regarding the reimbursement for the double invoicing from Conex, should we expect that to be processed soon? Will it be credited to our account? Just want to keep my leadership informed.

Hello,

 

Current charges for recycling $1483.16.

 

We can switch to Arrow Waste for $1020.00/month for the same services. 

 

Removal for two containers would be $150 ($75.00 each) and delivery for two containers would be $150 ($75.00 each).

 

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with switching.

Hi Christy- while I can not see the service levels from Conex, we can pull in the Waste Management team to re-bid this service to get the vendor and subsequent invoice onto the centralized bill at hopefully a reduced cost!

 

Could I get a copy of the recent invoice from Conex?  I’ll use that to queue up WM and we’ll see what they can do for us.

	Are you seeing cheaper Conex bills on other properties?

	 

	Background: Melanie canceled the Rubicon contract and switched to Waste Management for better pricing in December. Previously, Rubicon had contracted Conex for services, and payments were made directly to Rubicon. After Melanie canceled the contract, we realized Conex had stopped service. I contacted Centralized Billing, and they assisted in re-establishing the Conex account. I initially assumed Centralized Billing was handling the invoices, but I later received them via email. Upon reaching out for confirmation, I was informed that Centralized Billing does not pay Conex invoices, which is why there are outstanding payments. Accounting has been accruing for trash  - but I need a better understanding of what Centralized Billing pays on behalf of Porter. I’ll try to research this week.

Hi Kelsey- the only thing that needs to be done is for someone from the property team to call the City, 512-930-3640 and simply confirm that Greystar is the new operator. 

 

They want to hear from us, NOT WM, for this confirmation. Once the city is contacted and there are remaining questions, let me know and we’ll get a call on the calendar!

 

Thanks

Jeff

 

 

Immediately below are the Cliff Notes:

 

Our vendor team has reached back out to me, indicating that they are still having difficulty getting the City to update the billing address. 

 

At this time, the City does not believe Greystar has taken over the management for Wood Partners; they will not take the tax ID we have provided and will not take the LOA provided by your corporate office.  They have stated that they require a call from the Property directly in order to provide more details.  If you would like to stay on the WM National Accounts for Mighty 90's compliance, we are hoping that you can assist us in contacting the city to provide whatever information is needed for them to cooperate with us.  

 

Right now, the billing address on file is WOOD PARTNERS, 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN, TX 78633.  We need it updated to GREYSTAR ALTA BERRY CREEK GRY000415, PO BOX 589, WINDSOR CT 06095.

 

I had requested that our vendor team keep reaching out to the City for invoice copies until we actually began receiving them.  The last invoice received was the 5/19 invoice for April services.  When one of our agents contacted the City for the May and June invoices, he was informed that the account is current and there was no open balance, so he was unable to obtain those invoice copies.  

 

Chris, I know you indicated previously that Conservice was receiving invoices; however, they were the invoices that WM sends each month that reflect “Do Not Pay” on them, since payment is being made by your corporate office.  Is there any chance that Conservice actually is still paying invoices that they may be receiving directly from the City?  Would you be able to ask the City to confirm if they are sending invoices to multiple recipients, and then information on all payments received?   Below is the list of invoices that WM has paid, to date.  We do not have the invoices for May or June, since the City is saying that they have already been paid.

Hi all, 

 

I'm sorry you haven't gotten a response on this - we've had a shift in staffing on site, but I'd love to help resolve this. 

 

Do you mind catching me up slightly? What program is this for? Is there a department or number with the city I need to call to verify change of management and provide any documentation necessary. 

 

I've included our Senior Regional Manager as well, Tayler Martin. We'll ensure this is resolved, between the two of us.

Hello Christopher,

 

We are continuing to work with the City to get the billing change completed.  They are now saying that they are unable to change the billing address until they have a copy of the property’s W-9 form for their records.  Part of the delay is because they still have this under Wood Partners.  They will only make the update if they receive the W-9 for your property under Greystar.  I’m looping in Jeff/Richard under @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  as well in case their assistance is needed.

 

Are you able to provide this ASAP?  

 

Thanks,

From talking to Conservice what billing they have received does have the wrong address on it. It has our property address and not the address for Conservice. Also, what they have received to date is very small amounts and I have attached a copy of one of the invoices. They say on them do not pay. They have not received anything for monthly billing as you would expect. I do not have access to the city billing portal as do not handle the processing here on site. I did ask Conservice if they do and they said they do not.

Good morning Chris,

 

I am terribly sorry for the delayed response.  Question – were you drafted from Conservice or paid them directly for January and February?

 

We are finally getting somewhere with the City of Georgetown.  They have sent over the April invoice, which appears to have a past due balance for March only.  Do you have access to the city billing portal by any chance?   If you have any way to access the invoices to send over to me, that would be a huge help.  If not, no worries – our vendor team is following up with the City daily asking for all unpaid invoices.  I am also following up with our team to ensure they are doing their due diligence to obtain them, and also confirm that the City has finally updated the billing address as they should have originally.

 

I will be sure to notify you when we have this matter resolved.

 

Thank you,

Hello Chris,

 

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Our Vendor Management team has been reaching out to the City of Georgetown for outstanding invoices.  Are you able to confirm if you have received anything from them?  The remit address previously was WOOD PARTNERS 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN TX 78633. 

 

I have escalated this further, but if you did receive any invoices, please send them over ASAP.

I was given your email as our rep for our account. If this is correct thank you and if not can you possibly guide me in the direction of whom that might be.

I am assuming because of the holiday why no service yesterday and checking to see if that service will be today instead?

Thank you

Hi all, 

 

I'm sorry you haven't gotten a response on this - we've had a shift in staffing on site, but I'd love to help resolve this. 

 

Do you mind catching me up slightly? What program is this for? Is there a department or number with the city I need to call to verify change of management and provide any documentation necessary. 

 

I've included our Senior Regional Manager as well, Tayler Martin. We'll ensure this is resolved, between the two of us.

I wanted to follow up once more on this matter.  Have you had a chance to connect with the city?  If you would like to stay on the WM National Accounts program for Mighty 90's compliance, we need your assistance with contacting the city to provide whatever information is needed for them to cooperate with us.  

 

If we instead need to remove the property from the program, please let me know.

Good morning,

 

Our vendor team has reached back out to me, indicating that they are still having difficulty getting the City to update the billing address. 

 

At this time, the City does not believe Greystar has taken over the management for Wood Partners; they will not take the tax ID we have provided and will not take the LOA provided by your corporate office.  They have stated that they require a call from the Property directly in order to provide more details.  If you would like to stay on the WM National Accounts for Mighty 90's compliance, we are hoping that you can assist us in contacting the city to provide whatever information is needed for them to cooperate with us.  

 

Right now, the billing address on file is WOOD PARTNERS, 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN, TX 78633.  We need it updated to GREYSTAR ALTA BERRY CREEK GRY000415, PO BOX 589, WINDSOR CT 06095.

 

I had requested that our vendor team keep reaching out to the City for invoice copies until we actually began receiving them.  The last invoice received was the 5/19 invoice for April services.  When one of our agents contacted the City for the May and June invoices, he was informed that the account is current and there was no open balance, so he was unable to obtain those invoice copies.  

 

Chris, I know you indicated previously that Conservice was receiving invoices; however, they were the invoices that WM sends each month that reflect “Do Not Pay” on them, since payment is being made by your corporate office.  Is there any chance that Conservice actually is still paying invoices that they may be receiving directly from the City?  Would you be able to ask the City to confirm if they are sending invoices to multiple recipients, and then information on all payments received?   Below is the list of invoices that WM has paid, to date.  We do not have the invoices for May or June, since the City is saying that they have already been paid.

Hello Christopher,

 

We are continuing to work with the City to get the billing change completed.  They are now saying that they are unable to change the billing address until they have a copy of the property’s W-9 form for their records.  Part of the delay is because they still have this under Wood Partners.  They will only make the update if they receive the W-9 for your property under Greystar.  I’m looping in Jeff/Richard under @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  as well in case their assistance is needed.

 

Are you able to provide this ASAP?  

 

Thanks,

From talking to Conservice what billing they have received does have the wrong address on it. It has our property address and not the address for Conservice. Also, what they have received to date is very small amounts and I have attached a copy of one of the invoices. They say on them do not pay. They have not received anything for monthly billing as you would expect. I do not have access to the city billing portal as do not handle the processing here on site. I did ask Conservice if they do and they said they do not.

Good morning Chris,

 

I am terribly sorry for the delayed response.  Question – were you drafted from Conservice or paid them directly for January and February?

 

We are finally getting somewhere with the City of Georgetown.  They have sent over the April invoice, which appears to have a past due balance for March only.  Do you have access to the city billing portal by any chance?   If you have any way to access the invoices to send over to me, that would be a huge help.  If not, no worries – our vendor team is following up with the City daily asking for all unpaid invoices.  I am also following up with our team to ensure they are doing their due diligence to obtain them, and also confirm that the City has finally updated the billing address as they should have originally.

 

I will be sure to notify you when we have this matter resolved.

 

Thank you,

Hello Chris,

 

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Our Vendor Management team has been reaching out to the City of Georgetown for outstanding invoices.  Are you able to confirm if you have received anything from them?  The remit address previously was WOOD PARTNERS 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN TX 78633. 

 

I have escalated this further, but if you did receive any invoices, please send them over ASAP.

I was given your email as our rep for our account. If this is correct thank you and if not can you possibly guide me in the direction of whom that might be.

I am assuming because of the holiday why no service yesterday and checking to see if that service will be today instead?

Hi all, 

 

I'm sorry you haven't gotten a response on this - we've had a shift in staffing on site, but I'd love to help resolve this. 

 

Do you mind catching me up slightly? What program is this for? Is there a department or number with the city I need to call to verify change of management and provide any documentation necessary. 

 

I've included our Senior Regional Manager as well, Tayler Martin. We'll ensure this is resolved, between the two of us.

Good morning,

 

Our vendor team has reached back out to me, indicating that they are still having difficulty getting the City to update the billing address. 

 

At this time, the City does not believe Greystar has taken over the management for Wood Partners; they will not take the tax ID we have provided and will not take the LOA provided by your corporate office.  They have stated that they require a call from the Property directly in order to provide more details.  If you would like to stay on the WM National Accounts for Mighty 90's compliance, we are hoping that you can assist us in contacting the city to provide whatever information is needed for them to cooperate with us.  

 

Right now, the billing address on file is WOOD PARTNERS, 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN, TX 78633.  We need it updated to GREYSTAR ALTA BERRY CREEK GRY000415, PO BOX 589, WINDSOR CT 06095.

 

I had requested that our vendor team keep reaching out to the City for invoice copies until we actually began receiving them.  The last invoice received was the 5/19 invoice for April services.  When one of our agents contacted the City for the May and June invoices, he was informed that the account is current and there was no open balance, so he was unable to obtain those invoice copies.  

 

Chris, I know you indicated previously that Conservice was receiving invoices; however, they were the invoices that WM sends each month that reflect “Do Not Pay” on them, since payment is being made by your corporate office.  Is there any chance that Conservice actually is still paying invoices that they may be receiving directly from the City?  Would you be able to ask the City to confirm if they are sending invoices to multiple recipients, and then information on all payments received?   Below is the list of invoices that WM has paid, to date.  We do not have the invoices for May or June, since the City is saying that they have already been paid.

Hello Christopher,

 

We are continuing to work with the City to get the billing change completed.  They are now saying that they are unable to change the billing address until they have a copy of the property’s W-9 form for their records.  Part of the delay is because they still have this under Wood Partners.  They will only make the update if they receive the W-9 for your property under Greystar.  I’m looping in Jeff/Richard under @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  as well in case their assistance is needed.

 

Are you able to provide this ASAP?

From talking to Conservice what billing they have received does have the wrong address on it. It has our property address and not the address for Conservice. Also, what they have received to date is very small amounts and I have attached a copy of one of the invoices. They say on them do not pay. They have not received anything for monthly billing as you would expect. I do not have access to the city billing portal as do not handle the processing here on site. I did ask Conservice if they do and they said they do not.

Good morning Chris,

 

I am terribly sorry for the delayed response.  Question – were you drafted from Conservice or paid them directly for January and February?

 

We are finally getting somewhere with the City of Georgetown.  They have sent over the April invoice, which appears to have a past due balance for March only.  Do you have access to the city billing portal by any chance?   If you have any way to access the invoices to send over to me, that would be a huge help.  If not, no worries – our vendor team is following up with the City daily asking for all unpaid invoices.  I am also following up with our team to ensure they are doing their due diligence to obtain them, and also confirm that the City has finally updated the billing address as they should have originally.

 

I will be sure to notify you when we have this matter resolved.

 

Thank you,

Hello Chris,

 

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Our Vendor Management team has been reaching out to the City of Georgetown for outstanding invoices.  Are you able to confirm if you have received anything from them?  The remit address previously was WOOD PARTNERS 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN TX 78633. 

 

I have escalated this further, but if you did receive any invoices, please send them over ASAP.

I was given your email as our rep for our account. If this is correct thank you and if not can you possibly guide me in the direction of whom that might be.

I am assuming because of the holiday why no service yesterday and checking to see if that service will be today instead?

Hi Angie,

 

The compactor had 7.10 tons in it when it was serviced on the 24th.  It would not have been able to hold 19.88 tons of trash (7.10 tons from the 24th and 12.78 tons from the 17th).  When it was serviced again on 8/12, it had 9.05 tons in it.  It could not have held 16.15 tons in it (9.05 tons from 8/12 and 7.10 tons from the 24th).  All hauls were needed that were performed. 

 

The only “extra costs” associated would have been for the trip charge and that was due to the car blocking the compactor when service was attempted on 7/6.

 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further on Tuesday.

 

Thanks,

Due to the delay on the pickup. We had the compactor being picked up on the 17th and again on the 24th. Charges for the "extra" pick up was $816.57.

Hi Angie,

 

Unfortunately, I am not available this afternoon.  Are you referring to this charge?

 



 

Every time the compactor is hauled, you are charged $185.66 for the haul charge (the truck coming to the property and getting the compactor, taking it to the landfill and bring it back to the property) and $115.01 per ton for the disposal of the waste inside the compactor.  If you have 5 tons in the compactor, it is $115.01x5 for the disposal portion.  If you have 12.78 tons, it is 12.78 tons x $115.01 for the disposal portion.

 

When your service was attempted on 7/6, the compactor area was blocked by a vehicle and the compactor could not be serviced.  The local office was not able to return for service until 7/17.  That does not change the amount of trash (or the weight) of the trash that your property is generating over the month.  It may change “when” you are charged for it.  Regardless of when that tonnage is picked up, you are charged $115.01 per ton (unless there are less than three tons, you are charged for a minimum of 3 tons).

 

If you would like to discuss further, I will be available at 1pm CST on Tuesday, otherwise, I will not be available again until October 22nd.

 

Thanks,

Hi Angie,

 

Your disposal per ton is the same whether you have 5 tons or 13 tons in it, you are charged per ton.  The only time you are charged more is if you have less than 3 tons because there is a 3 ton minimum.

The pick-up on 7/17 was delayed on your end. Had the schedule been maintained, the tonnage might have aligned with the expected rate.

Hello,

 

I was made aware you had some questions related to billing and your contract.

 

For the haul on 7/17, we cannot credit it.  Your compactor had 12.78 tons in it, that is at absolute max capacity.  Had we not serviced it, you would have had trash all over the ground and it would have been too heavy to pick up.

 

How can we assist with questions related to your contract?

## Email Content

Hi Laurie- makes sense and yes we have the option to request that WM be removed as the hauler and replaced with an alternative hauler if service is not meeting your standards.  This process is facilitated by WM (Rebekah & Dawn mostly) at our request, and we would want to be specific to call out Troupe if that’s who we want providing the service. 

 

There are a few possible implications with this approach:

1.	New rates may be more than what the property pays today
2.	There may be container/equipment removal charges from WM
3.	Container options & sizes may look a bit different 

 

These are each within the parameters of our National Agreement with WM. 

 

Next steps:

1.	Decide if we want to WM to put the services out to bid across 3-4 haulers or just to Troupe
2.	Think about the ideal timing for a transition to a new hauler- transitions generally go smooth but I would not suggest making a change around any sort of a holiday
3.	Ensure there are no labor disputes with the new hauler- Many of our assets in MA have had a few issues navigating labor issues with Republic recently. I believe the noise is quieting down but something we want to ensure does not happen as a result of any transition away from WM. 
4.	Coordinate with our onsite service team to be on alert during the transition- Rebekah and Dawn are also on alert during the transition.

 

 

I’m happy to jump on a quick call with you both for further Q/A. 

 

Thanks again,

Thank you Jeff as we definitely recognize the relationship between WM and Greystar.  I will defer to Angie as she is “boots on the ground” and experiencing the concerns with current trash removal.

 

For seeking out a new hauler, would that work in place of us replacing WM?  For example if Angie was looking to change to Troupe for hauling is that what you mean?  Please advise how that might work.  

 

Thank you.

Hi Laurie/Angie- I thought to check in as it’s  not common to have our properties leave the WM National program. Between the competitive pricing, Mighty90s compliance, ability to manage and optimize costs and overall support, we’ve had really good experiences with WM as a whole.  Was the reasoning over this 1 service issue?

 

As an alternative, we can seek out a new hauler if that is of interest instead of a full cancellation? That approach would keep all the benefits of the National program in place but replace WM as the hauler.

 

Thanks for the insight, glad to chat as well!

Hi Angie,

 

The compactor had 7.10 tons in it when it was serviced on the 24th.  It would not have been able to hold 19.88 tons of trash (7.10 tons from the 24th and 12.78 tons from the 17th).  When it was serviced again on 8/12, it had 9.05 tons in it.  It could not have held 16.15 tons in it (9.05 tons from 8/12 and 7.10 tons from the 24th).  All hauls were needed that were performed. 

 

The only “extra costs” associated would have been for the trip charge and that was due to the car blocking the compactor when service was attempted on 7/6.

 

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further on Tuesday.

 

Thanks,

Due to the delay on the pickup. We had the compactor being picked up on the 17th and again on the 24th. Charges for the "extra" pick up was $816.57.

Unfortunately, I am not available this afternoon.  Are you referring to this charge?

 



 

Every time the compactor is hauled, you are charged $185.66 for the haul charge (the truck coming to the property and getting the compactor, taking it to the landfill and bring it back to the property) and $115.01 per ton for the disposal of the waste inside the compactor.  If you have 5 tons in the compactor, it is $115.01x5 for the disposal portion.  If you have 12.78 tons, it is 12.78 tons x $115.01 for the disposal portion.

 

When your service was attempted on 7/6, the compactor area was blocked by a vehicle and the compactor could not be serviced.  The local office was not able to return for service until 7/17.  That does not change the amount of trash (or the weight) of the trash that your property is generating over the month.  It may change “when” you are charged for it.  Regardless of when that tonnage is picked up, you are charged $115.01 per ton (unless there are less than three tons, you are charged for a minimum of 3 tons).

 

If you would like to discuss further, I will be available at 1pm CST on Tuesday, otherwise, I will not be available again until October 22nd.

 

Thanks,

Hi Angie,

 

Your disposal per ton is the same whether you have 5 tons or 13 tons in it, you are charged per ton.  The only time you are charged more is if you have less than 3 tons because there is a 3 ton minimum.

The pick-up on 7/17 was delayed on your end. Had the schedule been maintained, the tonnage might have aligned with the expected rate.

Hello,

 

I was made aware you had some questions related to billing and your contract.

 

For the haul on 7/17, we cannot credit it.  Your compactor had 12.78 tons in it, that is at absolute max capacity.  Had we not serviced it, you would have had trash all over the ground and it would have been too heavy to pick up.

 

How can we assist with questions related to your contract?

 

Thanks,

Hey Galen- We have the monitor technology available, there is a 1-time $200 install and $150/mo subscription fee. For newly installed compactors it’s a great way to ‘set it and forget it’ as the technology does the communication to the hauler at times when tonnage is high to reduce haul counts over the course of a month, year, etc.

 

Please let me know if you’d like to proceed and/or chat through any Q & A.

 

Thanks much,

Hi Galen,

 

I would highly suggest working with @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  to have a monitor installed on the compactor from the get-go, so that it is only hauled when it is full.  Otherwise, I would anticipate 1x/wk (4.33 hauls per month) and 8 tons per haul or 34.64 tons per month.

 

For budgeting, I would budget for 4.33 hauls per month and 34.64 tons per month.  I would also budget whatever the monitor costs (Advantage Waste Solutions team can provide those costs to you).

 

Thanks,

Hi Rebekah,

 

Yes, I agree this seems really high. Will be interested to see once confirmed.

 

Also, for the compactor, are you suggesting just the on-call until we get a certain amount of residents moved in? If so, what are we thinking will be needed for servicing once we are full. As we are building a budget, hoping to get ideas on anticipated cost for servicing.

Hi Team,

 

We need a quote for servicing the compactor. We just don't know when this will be installed so we are looking at maybe doing the 8 yd until that is delivered.

 

Just let us know when you have the quote for the compactor please.

Hi Team,

 

We need a proposal for the compactor servicing and then a separate proposal for a standalone 8yd with servicing. The reason behind this is that we don't know when compactor will be installed so we may need to get an 8yd temporarily until compactor is installed.

Hello! I have two sites in Charleston, neither of which utilize Waste Management as they do not operate here. I would like to explore cost savings opportunities for both pretty urgently. Is there a way to utilize a compactor sensor for sites utilizing Republic and/or Trident for waste removal?

For onboarding to the WM program please send the most recent month of waste invoices and a copy of the service agreement/contract to teamgreystar@wm.com <mailto:teamgreystar@wm.com>  who is also on CC.   There is a $25/month admin fee, the process takes about 45-60 days to get fully onboarded and they can confirm exact dates.

 

2.	For compactor monitor evaluation and other cost savings opportunities- please send me 3 months of invoicing.  I’ll review and provide feedback by the end of the week.

 

 

Thanks much, 

Jeff

Hi there Beth- can you send me the last 2-3 months of waste invoicing for these two assets and I can guide you to potential cost savings.  

 

We can also onboard them to the WM National program which would allow us to see services, costs, opportunities for cost savings and Mighty90s compliant spend!

Hello! I have two sites in Charleston, neither of which utilize Waste Management as they do not operate here. I would like to explore cost savings opportunities for both pretty urgently. Is there a way to utilize a compactor sensor for sites utilizing Republic and/or Trident for waste removal?

Hi David- Thanks for submitting the request for a compactor quote. I’ve copied Gary on this email who is with Tower Compactor Rentals, they are our National Recommended Supplier for equipment and he’s in Texas. Gary has the form you submitted but will have some follow up questions.

 

You’re in good hands with Gary! If you need anything from me to compare rent VS buy or reviewing the quotes, please let me know.

 

Thanks

Good morning Jasmine- for equipment and service related items taking place at the property, yes. These docs are typically signed by ownership or USPM. 

 

Is this a new compactor for the property or replacing an old one?

 

One thing I will point out: our National Recommended Suppliers for compactor equipment are Tower and Compactor Rentals of America. While WM is capable in providing their equipment for rent, it’s neither their strong suit nor are they usually price competitive.  If we were to get quotes from Tower, for example, I suspect their rate would be in the mid to high $600s/month, possibly saving $200/month compared to WM. Additionally, the service/repair/parts arrangement that WM puts in place is not ideal. Tower and CRA have an all-in, no hassle rate that we’ve pre-negotiated. 

 

If you want to get a quote from Tower and/or CRA, please let me know and I’ll connect  you directly with Gary (Tower) or Dani (CRA)- they both move quickly to get us quotes, etc. 

 

Thanks much,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] WM-Proposal-AVANA AT THE MOORS-6200 NW 173RD ST HIALEAH FL 33015- (Compactor LEASE and WMC Compactor service) Greystar Supplier 

 

Good morning, Rebekah, and Jasmine, 

 

I hope you're both having a fantastic start to your week!

 

Please find attached the proposal for AVANA AT THE MOORS, which includes the following service details:

 

*	Lease for a 34-yard self-contained compactor
*	WMC service for the compactor, with weekly pickup on Wednesdays

 

Please kindly review the attached quote. Once approved, I will promptly send over the Greystar-approved agreements for both the lease and the WMC compactor service.

As you’re aware, the compactor needs to be ordered directly from the manufacturer. After the lease is signed, we will proceed with the order, which typically takes about 10-14 weeks for delivery to our facility.

 

If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I’m here to assist and ensure everything moves smoothly.

 

Looking forward to working with you at AVANA AT THE MOORS! 😊

Good Morning Aileen, 

The compactor is scheduled for pickup on Wednesdays. Regarding recycling, a program was paid for but is not actively being used. Instead, the service that is actually utilized is the bulk pickup on Mondays.

 

Thank you,

Subject: FOLLOW UP-AVANA AT THE MOORS- Greystar Supplier NOM: flavamoo - Avana at the Moors - FL
Importance: High

 

Good morning, Rebekah 

 

I hope you're having a wonderful start to your day.

 

I wanted to touch base regarding the property at Avana at the Moors. I’ve been trying to connect with the property manager but haven’t been able to reach them yet. In the meantime, I was able to visit the community and noticed they have a 40-yard self-contained compactor. However, I’m unsure about the service details, specifically, the frequency of collection and whether they have recycling services in place.

I’m currently awaiting a callback from the property manager to clarify if the compactor is serviced weekly or on an as-needed basis, and whether it is owned by the ownership or leased. Once I have this information, I’d love to prepare a tailored proposal for Avana at the Moors. 

 

Thank you so much for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Good morning Jasmine- for equipment and service related items taking place at the property, yes. These docs are typically signed by ownership or USPM. 

 

Is this a new compactor for the property or replacing an old one?

 

One thing I will point out: our National Recommended Suppliers for compactor equipment are Tower and Compactor Rentals of America. While WM is capable in providing their equipment for rent, it’s neither their strong suit nor are they usually price competitive.  If we were to get quotes from Tower, for example, I suspect their rate would be in the mid to high $600s/month, possibly saving $200/month compared to WM. Additionally, the service/repair/parts arrangement that WM puts in place is not ideal. Tower and CRA have an all-in, no hassle rate that we’ve pre-negotiated. 

 

If you want to get a quote from Tower and/or CRA, please let me know and I’ll connect  you directly with Gary (Tower) or Dani (CRA)- they both move quickly to get us quotes, etc. 

 

Thanks much,

Good morning, Rebekah, and Jasmine, 

 

I hope you're both having a fantastic start to your week!

 

Please find attached the proposal for AVANA AT THE MOORS, which includes the following service details:

 

*	Lease for a 34-yard self-contained compactor
*	WMC service for the compactor, with weekly pickup on Wednesdays

 

Please kindly review the attached quote. Once approved, I will promptly send over the Greystar-approved agreements for both the lease and the WMC compactor service.

As you’re aware, the compactor needs to be ordered directly from the manufacturer. After the lease is signed, we will proceed with the order, which typically takes about 10-14 weeks for delivery to our facility.

 

If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I’m here to assist and ensure everything moves smoothly.

 

Looking forward to working with you at AVANA AT THE MOORS! 😊

Good Morning Aileen, 

The compactor is scheduled for pickup on Wednesdays. Regarding recycling, a program was paid for but is not actively being used. Instead, the service that is actually utilized is the bulk pickup on Mondays.

 

Thank you,

Subject: FOLLOW UP-AVANA AT THE MOORS- Greystar Supplier NOM: flavamoo - Avana at the Moors - FL
Importance: High

 

Good morning, Rebekah 

 

I hope you're having a wonderful start to your day.

 

I wanted to touch base regarding the property at Avana at the Moors. I’ve been trying to connect with the property manager but haven’t been able to reach them yet. In the meantime, I was able to visit the community and noticed they have a 40-yard self-contained compactor. However, I’m unsure about the service details, specifically, the frequency of collection and whether they have recycling services in place.

I’m currently awaiting a callback from the property manager to clarify if the compactor is serviced weekly or on an as-needed basis, and whether it is owned by the ownership or leased. Once I have this information, I’d love to prepare a tailored proposal for Avana at the Moors. 

 

Thank you so much for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sounds great, you could also ask them to send over a boilerplate agreement and I can do the review on the Ts/Cs. They can be a bit onerous.

## Email Content

Hi Katie/Annie- this is unfortunate, but we should move quickly and engage with Pamela at Star Waste.  I would also suggest taking a look at the property’s service true service requirements. To avoid safety issues or service challenge with Star (repeating what WM has gone through), it may take some creative thinking and investment so we don’t put Star in an awkward or unsafe situation. 

 

I am happy to review quotes and contracts once  you have those from Star or help fill other gaps as you see fit during this transition.

 

Thanks much,

Hello,

 

We were notified by our local office that due to the ongoing service and safety concerns; they would like to give a 30-day notice.  Our compliance team has also notified us that the property will no longer be able to be on the WM National Account program after that 30 day as well because of the liability issues related to the safety concerns.

 

Prior to our compliance team notifying me that we would no be able to manage the property due to the safety concerns, I had started the process of trying to find another vendor.  However, due to the service constraints (service after 7:30am, traffic, etc) and safety concerns, we were only able to get one vendor to respond.  I’m providing that vendor contact information below, so you can reach out to them for bids.

## Email Content

Good morning Jasmine- for equipment and service related items taking place at the property, yes. These docs are typically signed by ownership or USPM. 

 

Is this a new compactor for the property or replacing an old one?

 

One thing I will point out: our National Recommended Suppliers for compactor equipment are Tower and Compactor Rentals of America. While WM is capable in providing their equipment for rent, it’s neither their strong suit nor are they usually price competitive.  If we were to get quotes from Tower, for example, I suspect their rate would be in the mid to high $600s/month, possibly saving $200/month compared to WM. Additionally, the service/repair/parts arrangement that WM puts in place is not ideal. Tower and CRA have an all-in, no hassle rate that we’ve pre-negotiated. 

 

If you want to get a quote from Tower and/or CRA, please let me know and I’ll connect  you directly with Gary (Tower) or Dani (CRA)- they both move quickly to get us quotes, etc. 

 

Thanks much,

Good morning, Rebekah, and Jasmine, 

 

I hope you're both having a fantastic start to your week!

 

Please find attached the proposal for AVANA AT THE MOORS, which includes the following service details:

 

*	Lease for a 34-yard self-contained compactor
*	WMC service for the compactor, with weekly pickup on Wednesdays

 

Please kindly review the attached quote. Once approved, I will promptly send over the Greystar-approved agreements for both the lease and the WMC compactor service.

As you’re aware, the compactor needs to be ordered directly from the manufacturer. After the lease is signed, we will proceed with the order, which typically takes about 10-14 weeks for delivery to our facility.

 

If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I’m here to assist and ensure everything moves smoothly.

 

Looking forward to working with you at AVANA AT THE MOORS! 😊

The compactor is scheduled for pickup on Wednesdays. Regarding recycling, a program was paid for but is not actively being used. Instead, the service that is actually utilized is the bulk pickup on Mondays.

Subject: FOLLOW UP-AVANA AT THE MOORS- Greystar Supplier NOM: flavamoo - Avana at the Moors - FL
Importance: High

 

Good morning, Rebekah 

 

I hope you're having a wonderful start to your day.

 

I wanted to touch base regarding the property at Avana at the Moors. I’ve been trying to connect with the property manager but haven’t been able to reach them yet. In the meantime, I was able to visit the community and noticed they have a 40-yard self-contained compactor. However, I’m unsure about the service details, specifically, the frequency of collection and whether they have recycling services in place.

I’m currently awaiting a callback from the property manager to clarify if the compactor is serviced weekly or on an as-needed basis, and whether it is owned by the ownership or leased. Once I have this information, I’d love to prepare a tailored proposal for Avana at the Moors. 

 

Thank you so much for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

## Email Content

Hi Christina- this is a great step forward! If I understand the objective correctly, I made a few minor edits noted inline. 

 

We’d likely need to set the right expectations with the teams for turn around times and where/how feedback is provided once our review is completed. 

Would this apply for all new acquisitions and new construction developments?

 

Thanks Christina,

Hi Richard and Team-

 

I am working to add a task to our Due Diligence / Acquisition process to include vetting the Waste Management Strategy for new communities. Would you gut check me and let me know if this task reads correctly? Is there any additional detail I should provide? Any other property info needed? Does the vendor need to go onsite to conduct this analysis? Do I have the correct POC to reach out to?

 

Task: Reach out to the Advantage Waste Optimize Services Team at waste@greystar.com <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  to determine if the community is a good candidate for proactive waste services review. management strategies. Please be prepared to provide 3-6 months of recent hauling invoices and waste contract for this analysis This could result in significant savings on the property operating budget.

 

Please note: Any and all feedback welcome, I just pulled together a task after reading the thread below and my words may need refining. 😉

Here is the list of locations that we have recommended adopt that did not end up signing up for GIG only. 

 



 

How often are we evaluating the portfolio?

*                 We typically run this twice a year and can run a fresh new batch. 

Are we having you evaluate new acquisitions at takeover?

*                 If the haulers invoices are provided from the new acquisition, then we can run an analysis to see if it's a good fit immediately. Otherwise, we will just run an analysis when we have enough data (typically 3 months) from WMNS.

One note – I don’t recognize the asset listed Sawyer Preserve, can you check on that one. Not a big impact to our numbers but want to make sure the reporting is right.

 

I also recently heard that this impacted some properties compliance in Mighty 90’s – has anyone brought that to your attention and is that true? If so, anything we can do about that?

Hi Lauren,

Apologies.  I was on vacation last week and WOAH those always feel like a bad idea once I get back LOL.  I'm still digging out. 

 

I can absolutely get you what you need.    You just want the Greystar Gig highlights by themselves?  I've included the PowerPoint Slides if that helps at all but I'm happy to make you something a little more customized if that is helpful.

 

Chelsea - Can you assist with the second part of Laurens question?

 

Asya - the "ISSUES" listed are actual invoice audits.  They found 16 instances where billing didn't match which resulted in $260.98 in credits back to the property.  Nothing earth shattering LOL, but nice to know its happening and saving the site teams money.  You had to click the review button at the bottom to get this.  I'll try to work on making a few of these items more clear

 

The Advantage Waste Optimize team is pleased to report strong performance and savings for Greystar Investment Group in 2025. Through proactive waste management strategies, we've delivered $53,405 in year-to-date savings, demonstrating the tangible benefits of our partnership. Top performing sites include Avana SoCo, Uptown Square, and Park at Armand Bayou. Our efforts extend beyond cost savings; we've also prevented 168 unnecessary pickups, improving operational efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. We processed 213 invoices and proactively flagged 16 issues, securing $260.98 in credits, and ensuring billing accuracy.

Hi Team,

So I took a little different tact this year.  I built a dashboard with details since our data set is getting larger and harder to communicate.  I'm happy to expand on this however you need it.  I'm hoping our team is able to build something like this in PowerBI soon.  GIG's results increased 7-fold.  As I promised they would and will continue to grow with added sites and time.  $50k since Jan 1 2025.  GIG is grouped in with other clients so I could create a dashboard that answers a lot of questions for a lot of different people with one resource, but it's sorted by client.  GIG has two views.  Summary view and property by property view.  I can also send via a power point presentation but thats like 20 slides LOL.  Just sneak a peek and let me know what you think.  I'm thinking through what the future version of our Advantage Waste team looks like for USPM teams.   And be sure to check out Trash Boss and tell me what you think.    We are pushing $120k for the year across the initial 70 locations.

 

As a side note we went from I think $35k to $120k from Q1 to Q2 for Greystar Overall, and $7k to $52k for GIG.  That will continue to expand in multiples.  See the link below.

Sorry.. this got caught in my drafts.  

HI Josh,

I hope it was helpful.  The ScreenCast is a feature in SnagIT which is readily available through a IT Help Desk ticket.  I think its around $50-$60 per YEAR.  Its super easy to use.  Also has a great STEP feature that will capture what you do on your screen and create a document for you that shows a step by step process like finding a report in a BI Tool.  Watches what you do and pops out a detailed instructional.

LOL.  Dont get me started on AI Stuff.  We could be here all day!

 

All the savings you see are recognized and include the monthly cost of $150 per month for the sensor.  So savings are net the sensor cost.

 

Next Quarter we will have double the GIG properties on the program and with more time each property will continue to show more and more savings.  We find savings by reducing how many times the trash truck shows up to pickup the compactors so with more time we can show more savings.

 

We have one property with Related called BridgeWater.  They are at $14k in savings in around 4 months.  They have 2 compactors on one site.

Thanks, Richard.  This is great. 

 

Ok, first.  That Screencast thing WAS AWESOME.  Can anybody do that?  Do you pay for Pro?

 

I’m sure Long Point was some issue outside the scope of the project.

 

Do the savings below include the $450 cost for the sensor?  So Village on the Lake really saved $468 but we subtracted out the cost of the sensor?  Or did they really lose $432?  $450-$18 savings – total cost $432.

 

We’ll probably wait one more quarter and then go for approval to add more sites.

Richard,

 

This is great.  Seems like a lot of opportunity available for savings.  Once we see the actual data, we can move forward with getting the rest approved. 

 

First question – the sites with blank net annual savings and 100% savings, are those data glitches that will be fixed and we can add those to the future list as well? 

 

Second question – are there other opportunities out there for portfolio-wide savings that we could test as well?  We had George Stephens bring us a proposal from ExactWater to install some device on our water main to remove the noise in the water flow that should reduce water bills by 15%.  We’re going to test that but anything else out there that we might not know about, we’d love to give them a shot.

Hi Josh,

I just sent this over to Asya and Malissa earlier in the week.   

We are close and working to pull those together in the next couple weeks.  We don’t get some of the March billing data until April 20.  Thats the lag here.  

We did also launch a new tool.  Power BI - We are sophisticated trash folks LOL

This will be connected to Greystar Analytics soon.  We will also be building out several reports for our teams.  In the interim if you click on the link you can see any new opportunities.  We did a fresh data pull 2 weeks ago.

We will also be uploading the KPI results into this BI Tool monthly so in the future we will have access to the savings much sooner than quarterly.    We just have to wrap up the API.

 

Right now we are still on track for the 15th?  I can’t wait to see it either.

Good call Lauren.  It will be completely separate from WM, but I hope to get it setup as a service that WM will handle billing on in the near future.

The supplier is a fully vetted and approved national recommended supplier, fully compliant ect.

 

DSQ Technologies is where the invoices will come from.  Monthly billed at $150 per month for the sensor.  Any savings profiles we provide your team will already account for that sensor cost In the calculations just for clarity.

It does have normal 30 day cancellation but can be assumed. 

 

Does that help?

That’s great, thanks! Thank you both for your help getting all of our assets signed up that you recommended. Look forward to seeing the savings reflected and would love to have it easily accessible in BI.

 

@Jennifer King <mailto:jennifer.king@greystar.com>  and @Michael Levine <mailto:michael.levine@greystar.com>  we ran through this for Conventional but you probably want to chat with Richard about the potential for your Student and Active Adult assets below. Looks like you have a few that could see some nice savings if you install the monitors at the Trash Compactors.

 

Territory Leaders – keep an eye/ear out for any issues with the change in pick up services.

 

@Richard Bates <mailto:richard.bates@greystar.com>  is this a completely separate contract from Waste Management and if so what’s the name. I would like our Transaction Team @Christina Schnellmann <mailto:c.schnellmann@greystar.com>  to flag it to look for it on Contract Summaries going forward for any of our sites for upcoming disposition. If I remember correctly it had normal 30 day cancelation terms if needed? Is it assumable by a buyer?

Hi Lauren,

Here are the sites we launched.  It takes a bit of time, but we should start seeing savings show up on our first quarterly report that will likely come out mid April timeframe.

We create a PPT Presentation showing the results by location, but I’m working to get the data into PowerBI which will make sharing results much easier than a PPT Deck.

 

Asya – I’m not sure the 8 sites below were part of our launch.  I believe some are student.  Again future iterations of this will be in Power BI attached to our attribute report so much easier to sort and compile and manage.

Hi Lauren,

I have an update around via spreadsheet I pulled last week. Let me chase that down real quick.  Progress has been great.  I think we only have a handful I might ask Asya’s team to help me knudge.

Hi Team,

 

Just wanted to check in to see how we are progressing getting our sites signed up?

 

If we’ve made some decent progress I wanted to consider setting up a future update – maybe 3 months out or whatever timeframe recommended to review the improvement or performance on the assets where we installed the monitors.

 

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks Demi, that compactor should hold 7 tons on average.

 

Perhaps talk with Trident about changing the frequency to ‘on call’ which leaves the property team responsible for calling Trident when it’s full or nearly full. It can likely go a full 2 weeks in between hauls. Summertime and warm weather may present challenges with that due to odors which you and the service team can work through. 

 

That is your best chance at cost savings: Fewer hauls per month!

 

In the conversation with Trident- it may not hurt to ask about getting a more favorable rate for the hauling while you’re at it😊

 

Let me know if I can help any further, meanwhile we’ll get the property onboarded onto the WM program and in about 45-60 days we can ask WM to re-bid it and see what they get back.

Thanks Demi- at 1st glance, the frequency of the compactor haul appears to be too frequent as weights are really low, averaging 2 tons. The 25-24yard compactors should hold 6-8 tons.  It appears to be on a set schedule for 1x/week, if you were able to monitor the fullness and reduce the hauls to every 12 days, you could eliminate $350/mo in hauling costs as a 1st step. 

 

Do you know what size compactor you have and/or could you send a picture?

Hi there Beth- can you send me the last 2-3 months of waste invoicing for these two assets and I can guide you to potential cost savings.  

 

We can also onboard them to the WM National program which would allow us to see services, costs, opportunities for cost savings and Mighty90s compliant spend!

 

Thanks much,

Hello! I have two sites in Charleston, neither of which utilize Waste Management as they do not operate here. I would like to explore cost savings opportunities for both pretty urgently. Is there a way to utilize a compactor sensor for sites utilizing Republic and/or Trident for waste removal?

Our VM team will flush out the details.  Hopefully, they will share more as they find out, but that is part of the reason I put the reminder on my calendar.  Usually, it is a whole franchise area, so if the current agreement covers King County, it could be switching for the whole county.

 

For anything set up on the WM National Account today, it should be switched over to Recology and remain on the national account on January 1st.

 

Wait, who am I talking to?  23yo in 2015?! 😊

Good morning,

 

I just received a call from Recology. They informed me that as of January 1st, 2026, all Waste Management accounts will be moved over to Recology as Waste Management will no longer be servicing the city of Redmond (or anywhere in King County). I spoke with Serena and their contract number is 425-552-1008. They do not have an email for account setup. 

 

I informed them that we are currently on a Greystar National Waste Management account and asked if they already have a National account set up for Greystar for Recology and she said that there is not to her knowledge. Will Greystar be setting up a National account for Recology?

	Hi Amanda, 

	We can look into making those adjustments for sure! However, before that can be done, we are going to need the waste management invoices for during those time periods. So once those are received, we can look into that adjustment! 

	 

	For billing back the big haul, I am not seeing that in the Lease that we have. I would look into getting the lease updated and then we can get that set up. 

	 

	@Ryan Cooley <mailto:ryancooley@conservice.com>  Will you please give Amanda the information that is needed where she can be sending the Waste Management invoices? And then in the future where she can send the Big haul invoices.

		Here is an audit of our trash costs for the year from Waste Management and Large Item Hauling Company; should we be billing back for the Big Haul and Check Sammy large item removal expenses? Note: I reached out to the Greystar Waste Management National Account department to look into July's invoice because it should be just north of $15k. We'll need that corrected before 9/1/2025 when that utility batch is scheduled to post to the tenant ledgers.

			@Amanda Wright <mailto:amanda.wright@greystar.com>  you could also check with the Verde manager as I’m sure they’re on WM too. I would ask if they have WM on centralized billing (which comes through support fees) and if so, how Conservice is getting copies of the bills.

I wasn’t able to find any communication regarding this, but if we are being billed through support fees it seems like that would be the case. If that is, we would need to find out how you can still access the invoices for billing purposes.

				Good afternoon, 

				 

				No, we did not change providers. This is very odd, the trash bill charges were being applied in Yardi by Conservice up until January and then all of the sudden, it switches over to Support Fees as of February. @Tina Chambers <mailto:tina.chambers@greystar.com>  are you handling the Waste Management bills now instead of Conservice?

Good morning,

 

I just received a call from Recology. They informed me that as of January 1st, 2026, all Waste Management accounts will be moved over to Recology as Waste Management will no longer be servicing the city of Redmond (or anywhere in King County). I spoke with Serena and their contract number is 425-552-1008. They do not have an email for account setup. 

 

I informed them that we are currently on a Greystar National Waste Management account and asked if they already have a National account set up for Greystar for Recology and she said that there is not to her knowledge. Will Greystar be setting up a National account for Recology?

	Hi Amanda, 

	We can look into making those adjustments for sure! However, before that can be done, we are going to need the waste management invoices for during those time periods. So once those are received, we can look into that adjustment! 

	 

	For billing back the big haul, I am not seeing that in the Lease that we have. I would look into getting the lease updated and then we can get that set up. 

	 

	@Ryan Cooley <mailto:ryancooley@conservice.com>  Will you please give Amanda the information that is needed where she can be sending the Waste Management invoices? And then in the future where she can send the Big haul invoices.  

	 

	Thank you!

		They have added: GreystarWM@conservice.com <mailto:GreystarWM@conservice.com>  to the email distribution list and corrected my email address as they had it incorrect in their system. I've asked them to also send us both all of the 2025 invoice copies for our records as well.

		 

		Upon my audit, I found that April resident bill backs (2/1/25 - 3/1/25) and May resident bill backs (3/1/25 - 4/1/25) for trash were under billed to the residents by about half.

		

		 

		Here is an audit of our trash costs for the year from Waste Management and Large Item Hauling Company; should we be billing back for the Big Haul and Check Sammy large item removal expenses? Note: I reached out to the Greystar Waste Management National Account department to look into July's invoice because it should be just north of $15k. We'll need that corrected before 9/1/2025 when that utility batch is scheduled to post to the tenant ledgers.

Good morning,

 

I just received a call from Recology. They informed me that as of January 1st, 2026, all Waste Management accounts will be moved over to Recology as Waste Management will no longer be servicing the city of Redmond (or anywhere in King County). I spoke with Serena and their contract number is 425-552-1008. They do not have an email for account setup. 

 

I informed them that we are currently on a Greystar National Waste Management account and asked if they already have a National account set up for Greystar for Recology and she said that there is not to her knowledge. Will Greystar be setting up a National account for Recology?

 

Thank you,

	Hi Amanda, 

	We can look into making those adjustments for sure! However, before that can be done, we are going to need the waste management invoices for during those time periods. So once those are received, we can look into that adjustment! 

	 

	For billing back the big haul, I am not seeing that in the Lease that we have. I would look into getting the lease updated and then we can get that set up. 

	 

	@Ryan Cooley <mailto:ryancooley@conservice.com>  Will you please give Amanda the information that is needed where she can be sending the Waste Management invoices? And then in the future where she can send the Big haul invoices.  

	 

	Thank you!

		Upon my audit, I found that April resident bill backs (2/1/25 - 3/1/25) and May resident bill backs (3/1/25 - 4/1/25) for trash were under billed to the residents by about half.

		

		 

		Here is an audit of our trash costs for the year from Waste Management and Large Item Hauling Company; should we be billing back for the Big Haul and Check Sammy large item removal expenses? Note: I reached out to the Greystar Waste Management National Account department to look into July's invoice because it should be just north of $15k. We'll need that corrected before 9/1/2025 when that utility batch is scheduled to post to the tenant ledgers.

HI Jeff- 

 

For acquisition, I think it makes complete sense to have this analysis completed during DD. 

 

For the new development deals that are onboarding they typically start pre-leasing 30-90 days in advance, but delivery of first units (residents living onsite) may be a few or several months later with occupancy rising as residents move in. A typical lease up could take 12-16 months to stabilize (90%+). I would assume an “analysis” cannot really be competed unless there is waste hauling and contracts in place? Does it make sense to onboard a dev deal right away if you cannot conduct a true analysis?

Good morning- I saw the due diligence piece and imagined we’d be reviewing waste services during that period. If the waste review would take place after we close on a deal, truly anytime is fine. The more in advance the better so would say the 2 month window is great!

Hi Christina- this is a great step forward! If I understand the objective correctly, I made a few minor edits noted inline. 

 

We’d likely need to set the right expectations with the teams for turn around times and where/how feedback is provided once our review is completed. 

Would this apply for all new acquisitions and new construction developments?

Hi Richard and Team-

 

I am working to add a task to our Due Diligence / Acquisition process to include vetting the Waste Management Strategy for new communities. Would you gut check me and let me know if this task reads correctly? Is there any additional detail I should provide? Any other property info needed? Does the vendor need to go onsite to conduct this analysis? Do I have the correct POC to reach out to?

 

Task: Reach out to the Advantage Waste Optimize Services Team at waste@greystar.com <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  to determine if the community is a good candidate for proactive waste services review. management strategies. Please be prepared to provide 3-6 months of recent hauling invoices and waste contract for this analysis This could result in significant savings on the property operating budget.

 

Please note: Any and all feedback welcome, I just pulled together a task after reading the thread below and my words may need refining. 😉

Here is the list of locations that we have recommended adopt that did not end up signing up for GIG only. 

 



 

How often are we evaluating the portfolio?

*                 We typically run this twice a year and can run a fresh new batch. 

Are we having you evaluate new acquisitions at takeover?

*                 If the haulers invoices are provided from the new acquisition, then we can run an analysis to see if it's a good fit immediately. Otherwise, we will just run an analysis when we have enough data (typically 3 months) from WMNS.

Hi Lauren,

Apologies.  I was on vacation last week and WOAH those always feel like a bad idea once I get back LOL.  I'm still digging out. 

 

I can absolutely get you what you need.    You just want the Greystar Gig highlights by themselves?  I've included the PowerPoint Slides if that helps at all but I'm happy to make you something a little more customized if that is helpful.

 

Chelsea - Can you assist with the second part of Laurens question?

 

Asya - the "ISSUES" listed are actual invoice audits.  They found 16 instances where billing didn't match which resulted in $260.98 in credits back to the property.  Nothing earth shattering LOL, but nice to know its happening and saving the site teams money.  You had to click the review button at the bottom to get this.  I'll try to work on making a few of these items more clear

 

The Advantage Waste Optimize team is pleased to report strong performance and savings for Greystar Investment Group in 2025. Through proactive waste management strategies, we've delivered $53,405 in year-to-date savings, demonstrating the tangible benefits of our partnership. Top performing sites include Avana SoCo, Uptown Square, and Park at Armand Bayou. Our efforts extend beyond cost savings; we've also prevented 168 unnecessary pickups, improving operational efficiencies and reducing environmental impact. We processed 213 invoices and proactively flagged 16 issues, securing $260.98 in credits, and ensuring billing accuracy. We are committed to continuous improvement and optimizing your waste management program. If you have any questions, please reach out to waste@greystar.com <mailto:waste@greystar.com> .

Hi Team,

So I took a little different tact this year.  I built a dashboard with details since our data set is getting larger and harder to communicate.  I'm happy to expand on this however you need it.  I'm hoping our team is able to build something like this in PowerBI soon.  GIG's results increased 7-fold.  As I promised they would and will continue to grow with added sites and time.  $50k since Jan 1 2025.  GIG is grouped in with other clients so I could create a dashboard that answers a lot of questions for a lot of different people with one resource, but it's sorted by client.  GIG has two views.  Summary view and property by property view.  I can also send via a power point presentation but thats like 20 slides LOL.  Just sneak a peek and let me know what you think.  I'm thinking through what the future version of our Advantage Waste team looks like for USPM teams.   And be sure to check out Trash Boss and tell me what you think.    We are pushing $120k for the year across the initial 70 locations.

 

As a side note we went from I think $35k to $120k from Q1 to Q2 for Greystar Overall, and $7k to $52k for GIG.  That will continue to expand in multiples.  See the link below.

Sorry.. this got caught in my drafts.  

HI Josh,

I hope it was helpful.  The ScreenCast is a feature in SnagIT which is readily available through a IT Help Desk ticket.  I think its around $50-$60 per YEAR.  Its super easy to use.  Also has a great STEP feature that will capture what you do on your screen and create a document for you that shows a step by step process like finding a report in a BI Tool.  Watches what you do and pops out a detailed instructional.

LOL.  Dont get me started on AI Stuff.  We could be here all day!

 

All the savings you see are recognized and include the monthly cost of $150 per month for the sensor.  So savings are net the sensor cost.

 

Next Quarter we will have double the GIG properties on the program and with more time each property will continue to show more and more savings.  We find savings by reducing how many times the trash truck shows up to pickup the compactors so with more time we can show more savings.

 

We have one property with Related called BridgeWater.  They are at $14k in savings in around 4 months.  They have 2 compactors on one site.

Thanks, Richard.  This is great. 

 

Ok, first.  That Screencast thing WAS AWESOME.  Can anybody do that?  Do you pay for Pro?

 

I’m sure Long Point was some issue outside the scope of the project.

 

Do the savings below include the $450 cost for the sensor?  So Village on the Lake really saved $468 but we subtracted out the cost of the sensor?  Or did they really lose $432?  $450-$18 savings – total cost $432.

 

We’ll probably wait one more quarter and then go for approval to add more sites.

I wanted to share the Q1 results with you.  I created a summary of the findings below to save you some time reviewing the PPT slides.  

 

Just for some context.. Here is what we saved ALL Greystar in Q1 OVERALL - We have approx 30 properties LIVE.  This number will double if not triple next quarter.

Richard,

 

This is great.  Seems like a lot of opportunity available for savings.  Once we see the actual data, we can move forward with getting the rest approved. 

 

First question – the sites with blank net annual savings and 100% savings, are those data glitches that will be fixed and we can add those to the future list as well? 

 

Second question – are there other opportunities out there for portfolio-wide savings that we could test as well?  We had George Stephens bring us a proposal from ExactWater to install some device on our water main to remove the noise in the water flow that should reduce water bills by 15%.  We’re going to test that but anything else out there that we might not know about, we’d love to give them a shot.

Hi Josh,

I just sent this over to Asya and Malissa earlier in the week.   

We are close and working to pull those together in the next couple weeks.  We don’t get some of the March billing data until April 20.  Thats the lag here.  

We did also launch a new tool.  Power BI - We are sophisticated trash folks LOL

This will be connected to Greystar Analytics soon.  We will also be building out several reports for our teams.  In the interim if you click on the link you can see any new opportunities.  We did a fresh data pull 2 weeks ago.

We will also be uploading the KPI results into this BI Tool monthly so in the future we will have access to the savings much sooner than quarterly.    We just have to wrap up the API.

 

Right now we are still on track for the 15th?  I can’t wait to see it either.

Good call Lauren.  It will be completely separate from WM, but I hope to get it setup as a service that WM will handle billing on in the near future.

The supplier is a fully vetted and approved national recommended supplier, fully compliant ect.

 

DSQ Technologies is where the invoices will come from.  Monthly billed at $150 per month for the sensor.  Any savings profiles we provide your team will already account for that sensor cost In the calculations just for clarity.

It does have normal 30 day cancellation but can be assumed. 

 

Does that help?

That’s great, thanks! Thank you both for your help getting all of our assets signed up that you recommended. Look forward to seeing the savings reflected and would love to have it easily accessible in BI.

 

@Jennifer King <mailto:jennifer.king@greystar.com>  and @Michael Levine <mailto:michael.levine@greystar.com>  we ran through this for Conventional but you probably want to chat with Richard about the potential for your Student and Active Adult assets below. Looks like you have a few that could see some nice savings if you install the monitors at the Trash Compactors.

 

Territory Leaders – keep an eye/ear out for any issues with the change in pick up services.

 

@Richard Bates <mailto:richard.bates@greystar.com>  is this a completely separate contract from Waste Management and if so what’s the name. I would like our Transaction Team @Christina Schnellmann <mailto:c.schnellmann@greystar.com>  to flag it to look for it on Contract Summaries going forward for any of our sites for upcoming disposition. If I remember correctly it had normal 30 day cancelation terms if needed? Is it assumable by a buyer?

Hi Lauren,

Here are the sites we launched.  It takes a bit of time, but we should start seeing savings show up on our first quarterly report that will likely come out mid April timeframe.

We create a PPT Presentation showing the results by location, but I’m working to get the data into PowerBI which will make sharing results much easier than a PPT Deck.

 

Asya – I’m not sure the 8 sites below were part of our launch.  I believe some are student.  Again future iterations of this will be in Power BI attached to our attribute report so much easier to sort and compile and manage.

Hi Lauren,

I have an update around via spreadsheet I pulled last week. Let me chase that down real quick.  Progress has been great.  I think we only have a handful I might ask Asya’s team to help me knudge.

Hi Team,

 

Just wanted to check in to see how we are progressing getting our sites signed up?

 

If we’ve made some decent progress I wanted to consider setting up a future update – maybe 3 months out or whatever timeframe recommended to review the improvement or performance on the assets where we installed the monitors.

 

Let me know your thoughts.

## Email Content

Good morning- I saw the due diligence piece and imagined we’d be reviewing waste services during that period. If the waste review would take place after we close on a deal, truly anytime is fine. The more in advance the better so would say the 2 month window is great!

 

Thanks Christina, let me know if I’m misunderstanding something.

 

Have a great Friday!

Quick Question: How far in advance should the new dev deals reach out to you for this analysis? 1 month before opening, 2 months after move ins?

Hi Christina- this is a great step forward! If I understand the objective correctly, I made a few minor edits noted inline. 

 

We’d likely need to set the right expectations with the teams for turn around times and where/how feedback is provided once our review is completed. 

Would this apply for all new acquisitions and new construction developments?

 

Thanks Christina,

Hi Richard and Team-

 

I am working to add a task to our Due Diligence / Acquisition process to include vetting the Waste Management Strategy for new communities. Would you gut check me and let me know if this task reads correctly? Is there any additional detail I should provide? Any other property info needed? Does the vendor need to go onsite to conduct this analysis? Do I have the correct POC to reach out to?

 

Task: Reach out to the Advantage Waste Optimize Services Team at waste@greystar.com <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  to determine if the community is a good candidate for proactive waste services review. management strategies. Please be prepared to provide 3-6 months of recent hauling invoices and waste contract for this analysis This could result in significant savings on the property operating budget.

 

Please note: Any and all feedback welcome, I just pulled together a task after reading the thread below and my words may need refining. 😉

Hi Lauren,

 

Here is the list of locations that we have recommended adopt that did not end up signing up for GIG only. 

 



 

How often are we evaluating the portfolio?

*                 We typically run this twice a year and can run a fresh new batch. 

Are we having you evaluate new acquisitions at takeover?

*                 If the haulers invoices are provided from the new acquisition, then we can run an analysis to see if it's a good fit immediately. Otherwise, we will just run an analysis when we have enough data (typically 3 months) from WMNS.  

Thank you,

This is great, I’ll grab a couple of slides from the Q2 update that works perfect.

 

One note – I don’t recognize the asset listed Sawyer Preserve, can you check on that one. Not a big impact to our numbers but want to make sure the reporting is right.

 

I also recently heard that this impacted some properties compliance in Mighty 90’s – has anyone brought that to your attention and is that true? If so, anything we can do about that?

Hi Lauren,

Apologies.  I was on vacation last week and WOAH those always feel like a bad idea once I get back LOL.  I'm still digging out. 

 

I can absolutely get you what you need.    You just want the Greystar Gig highlights by themselves?  I've included the PowerPoint Slides if that helps at all but I'm happy to make you something a little more customized if that is helpful.

 

Chelsea - Can you assist with the second part of Laurens question?

 

Asya - the "ISSUES" listed are actual invoice audits.  They found 16 instances where billing didn't match which resulted in $260.98 in credits back to the property.  Nothing earth shattering LOL, but nice to know its happening and saving the site teams money.  You had to click the review button at the bottom to get this.  I'll try to work on making a few of these items more clear

 

The Advantage Waste Optimize team is pleased to report strong performance and savings for Greystar Investment Group in 2025. Through proactive waste management strategies, we've delivered $53,405 in year-to-date savings, demonstrating the tangible benefits of our partnership.

Hi Team,

So I took a little different tact this year.  I built a dashboard with details since our data set is getting larger and harder to communicate.  I'm happy to expand on this however you need it.  I'm hoping our team is able to build something like this in PowerBI soon.  GIG's results increased 7-fold.  As I promised they would and will continue to grow with added sites and time.  $50k since Jan 1 2025.  GIG is grouped in with other clients so I could create a dashboard that answers a lot of questions for a lot of different people with one resource, but it's sorted by client.  GIG has two views.  Summary view and property by property view.  I can also send via a power point presentation but thats like 20 slides LOL.  Just sneak a peek and let me know what you think.  I'm thinking through what the future version of our Advantage Waste team looks like for USPM teams.   And be sure to check out Trash Boss and tell me what you think.    We are pushing $120k for the year across the initial 70 locations.

 

As a side note we went from I think $35k to $120k from Q1 to Q2 for Greystar Overall, and $7k to $52k for GIG.  That will continue to expand in multiples.  See the link below.

Sorry.. this got caught in my drafts.  

HI Josh,

I hope it was helpful.  The ScreenCast is a feature in SnagIT which is readily available through a IT Help Desk ticket.  I think its around $50-$60 per YEAR.  Its super easy to use.  Also has a great STEP feature that will capture what you do on your screen and create a document for you that shows a step by step process like finding a report in a BI Tool.  Watches what you do and pops out a detailed instructional.

LOL.  Dont get me started on AI Stuff.  We could be here all day!

 

All the savings you see are recognized and include the monthly cost of $150 per month for the sensor.  So savings are net the sensor cost.

 

Next Quarter we will have double the GIG properties on the program and with more time each property will continue to show more and more savings.  We find savings by reducing how many times the trash truck shows up to pickup the compactors so with more time we can show more savings.

 

We have one property with Related called BridgeWater.  They are at $14k in savings in around 4 months.  They have 2 compactors on one site.

Thanks, Richard.  This is great. 

 

Ok, first.  That Screencast thing WAS AWESOME.  Can anybody do that?  Do you pay for Pro?

 

I’m sure Long Point was some issue outside the scope of the project.

 

Do the savings below include the $450 cost for the sensor?  So Village on the Lake really saved $468 but we subtracted out the cost of the sensor?  Or did they really lose $432?  $450-$18 savings – total cost $432.

 

We’ll probably wait one more quarter and then go for approval to add more sites.

Richard,

 

This is great.  Seems like a lot of opportunity available for savings.  Once we see the actual data, we can move forward with getting the rest approved. 

 

First question – the sites with blank net annual savings and 100% savings, are those data glitches that will be fixed and we can add those to the future list as well? 

 

Second question – are there other opportunities out there for portfolio-wide savings that we could test as well?  We had George Stephens bring us a proposal from ExactWater to install some device on our water main to remove the noise in the water flow that should reduce water bills by 15%.  We’re going to test that but anything else out there that we might not know about, we’d love to give them a shot.

Hi Josh,

I just sent this over to Asya and Malissa earlier in the week.   

We are close and working to pull those together in the next couple weeks.  We don’t get some of the March billing data until April 20.  Thats the lag here.  

We did also launch a new tool.  Power BI - We are sophisticated trash folks LOL

This will be connected to Greystar Analytics soon.  We will also be building out several reports for our teams.  In the interim if you click on the link you can see any new opportunities.  We did a fresh data pull 2 weeks ago.

We will also be uploading the KPI results into this BI Tool monthly so in the future we will have access to the savings much sooner than quarterly.    We just have to wrap up the API.

 

Right now we are still on track for the 15th?  I can’t wait to see it either.

Happy Friday!  I know in the email you said that mid-April would be when our first savings calculations will be available.  Are we still tracking to that date? 

 

I also wanted to reach out to ask that you include me and Asya on the report.

Good call Lauren.  It will be completely separate from WM, but I hope to get it setup as a service that WM will handle billing on in the near future.

The supplier is a fully vetted and approved national recommended supplier, fully compliant ect.

 

DSQ Technologies is where the invoices will come from.  Monthly billed at $150 per month for the sensor.  Any savings profiles we provide your team will already account for that sensor cost In the calculations just for clarity.

It does have normal 30 day cancellation but can be assumed. 

 

Does that help?

That’s great, thanks! Thank you both for your help getting all of our assets signed up that you recommended. Look forward to seeing the savings reflected and would love to have it easily accessible in BI.

 

@Jennifer King <mailto:jennifer.king@greystar.com>  and @Michael Levine <mailto:michael.levine@greystar.com>  we ran through this for Conventional but you probably want to chat with Richard about the potential for your Student and Active Adult assets below. Looks like you have a few that could see some nice savings if you install the monitors at the Trash Compactors.

 

Territory Leaders – keep an eye/ear out for any issues with the change in pick up services.

 

@Richard Bates <mailto:richard.bates@greystar.com>  is this a completely separate contract from Waste Management and if so what’s the name. I would like our Transaction Team @Christina Schnellmann <mailto:c.schnellmann@greystar.com>  to flag it to look for it on Contract Summaries going forward for any of our sites for upcoming disposition. If I remember correctly it had normal 30 day cancelation terms if needed? Is it assumable by a buyer?

Hi Lauren,

Here are the sites we launched.  It takes a bit of time, but we should start seeing savings show up on our first quarterly report that will likely come out mid April timeframe.

We create a PPT Presentation showing the results by location, but I’m working to get the data into PowerBI which will make sharing results much easier than a PPT Deck.

 

Asya – I’m not sure the 8 sites below were part of our launch.  I believe some are student.  Again future iterations of this will be in Power BI attached to our attribute report so much easier to sort and compile and manage.

Hi Lauren,

I have an update around via spreadsheet I pulled last week. Let me chase that down real quick.  Progress has been great.  I think we only have a handful I might ask Asya’s team to help me knudge.

Hi Team,

 

Just wanted to check in to see how we are progressing getting our sites signed up?

 

If we’ve made some decent progress I wanted to consider setting up a future update – maybe 3 months out or whatever timeframe recommended to review the improvement or performance on the assets where we installed the monitors.

 

Let me know your thoughts.

It is billing from the local WM to the property, temporarily.  Then we will switch it over to WM National Accounts.

 

We closed the account that was billing to the broker.

Hi Rebekah,

 

We are taking over management of Waters at Heritage in Gonzales, Louisiana on Monday. I think someone has already reached out to get the Waste Management contract switched over to our national contract. Do you know when this will happen? The new buyer is asking for proration purposes. 

 

Also, the name will be changing to The Oaks at Riverbend.

Subject: Concern Regarding North Tower Compactor Service
Importance: High

 

Good morning,

I wanted to reach out regarding a concern that was brought to my attention this morning by our Service Manager, Brandon. He informed me that the gentleman collecting trash from our North Tower compactor stated, very sternly, that he would be discontinuing service due to the presence of rodents.

While I understand the concern, I do want to note that Charlotte has been dealing with a widespread rodent issue for quite some time, and this is not unique to our property. This has been a preexisting challenge across multiple communities in our area for well over a year. We have active pest control services with Massey, who continue to assist us with traps, and our team is making every effort to keep the area as clean as possible.

Being told that trash service may be discontinued due to an issue outside of our immediate control feels both unfair and unethical. We cannot afford for trash not to be picked up, especially considering that our maintenance team is also responsible for entering the compactor areas to clean and push out carts.

I have personally inspected the area and can confirm it is not a daily occurrence to see rodents near the compactor. While I regret that this incident may have startled the driver, we are actively taking steps to mitigate the problem and need your partnership to continue service.

Please let me know if this matter was previously communicated to your team, and how we can work together to ensure service is not disrupted. I’ve cc’d Brandon for clarity should you need additional details.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Hi Rebekah,

 

We are taking over management of Waters at Heritage in Gonzales, Louisiana on Monday. I think someone has already reached out to get the Waste Management contract switched over to our national contract. Do you know when this will happen? The new buyer is asking for proration purposes. 

 

Also, the name will be changing to The Oaks at Riverbend.

Sincerely,

I spoke with Patrick, the chutes were built too close together.  He is working on arranging an onsite meeting with WM Compactor Solutions and Wilco.  They are the two parties that will need to discuss the changes that are needed to bump out the chutes so that the compactors can be installed and work properly.

Hi Rebekah-

 

Hoping you can help, at Verra in Boston, MA, our client is looking for some absolute certainty as to where the chutes should be configured, compactor installed, and such in our high rise and mid rise trash rooms.

 

Patrick Griffith is great to work with and we can't say enough good things but our client is looking for someone from Waste Management's construction or engineering team - if that's a thing- to review and assist in outlining proper placement within the trash rooms.

 

Do you have someone you can point us too?

Hello,

 

Hi Jeff,

 

Would you mind reaching out to this property and letting them know they should be contacting TeamGreystar@wm.com <mailto:TeamGreystar@wm.com>  prior to contacting WM’s C-Suite, and that your internal team is there to assist them should they find it necessary to escalate further?

 

They attempted to email Mike Watson (or maybe did), but emailed one of our SVPs around 12:31pm, but then didn’t email WM National Accounts (teamgreystar@wm.com <mailto:teamgreystar@wm.com> ) until an hour later.

		Dear Michael J. Watson,

		I am reaching out from Townhouse Atlanta, located at 450 Piedmont Ave, regarding an urgent matter with our trash compactor. Our hydraulic pump is currently out of service, and the compactor is now overflowing.

		We have made multiple attempts to coordinate with Waste Management for assistance, but unfortunately, we have experienced significant delays and have repeatedly been given unclear or inconsistent updates. This situation is creating both an operational and sanitary concern for our community.

		We urgently need a pickup of the overflowing compactor and, more importantly, timely follow-through on the commitments made by WM. We kindly ask that your team provide quicker response times and avoid making promises that are not kept, as this greatly impacts our residents and property operations.

		Please let me know when we can expect immediate action on this request. Your prompt attention and resolution would be greatly appreciated.

		
		With Gratitude,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] WM-Proposal-AVANA AT THE MOORS-6200 NW 173RD ST HIALEAH FL 33015- (Compactor LEASE and WMC Compactor service) Greystar Supplier 

 

Good morning, Rebekah, and Jasmine, 

 

I hope you're both having a fantastic start to your week!

 

Please find attached the proposal for AVANA AT THE MOORS, which includes the following service details:

 

*	Lease for a 34-yard self-contained compactor
*	WMC service for the compactor, with weekly pickup on Wednesdays

 

Please kindly review the attached quote. Once approved, I will promptly send over the Greystar-approved agreements for both the lease and the WMC compactor service.

As you’re aware, the compactor needs to be ordered directly from the manufacturer. After the lease is signed, we will proceed with the order, which typically takes about 10-14 weeks for delivery to our facility.

 

If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I’m here to assist and ensure everything moves smoothly.

 

Looking forward to working with you at AVANA AT THE MOORS! 😊

Good Morning Aileen, 

The compactor is scheduled for pickup on Wednesdays. Regarding recycling, a program was paid for but is not actively being used. Instead, the service that is actually utilized is the bulk pickup on Mondays.

 

Thank you,

Subject: FOLLOW UP-AVANA AT THE MOORS- Greystar Supplier NOM: flavamoo - Avana at the Moors - FL
Importance: High

 

Good morning, Rebekah 

 

I hope you're having a wonderful start to your day.

 

I wanted to touch base regarding the property at Avana at the Moors. I’ve been trying to connect with the property manager but haven’t been able to reach them yet. In the meantime, I was able to visit the community and noticed they have a 40-yard self-contained compactor. However, I’m unsure about the service details, specifically, the frequency of collection and whether they have recycling services in place.

I’m currently awaiting a callback from the property manager to clarify if the compactor is serviced weekly or on an as-needed basis, and whether it is owned by the ownership or leased. Once I have this information, I’d love to prepare a tailored proposal for Avana at the Moors. 

 

Thank you so much for your help. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hi all- let’s to parallel paths if we may:

1.	For onboarding to the WM program please send the most recent month of waste invoices and a copy of the service agreement/contract to teamgreystar@wm.com <mailto:teamgreystar@wm.com>  who is also on CC.   There is a $25/month admin fee, the process takes about 45-60 days to get fully onboarded and they can confirm exact dates.

 

2.	For compactor monitor evaluation and other cost savings opportunities- please send me 3 months of invoicing.  I’ll review and provide feedback by the end of the week.

Hi there Beth- can you send me the last 2-3 months of waste invoicing for these two assets and I can guide you to potential cost savings.  

 

We can also onboard them to the WM National program which would allow us to see services, costs, opportunities for cost savings and Mighty90s compliant spend!

 

Thanks much,

Hello! I have two sites in Charleston, neither of which utilize Waste Management as they do not operate here. I would like to explore cost savings opportunities for both pretty urgently. Is there a way to utilize a compactor sensor for sites utilizing Republic and/or Trident for waste removal?

Greetings ( I pulled in Danielle who may have been originally intended to be on this email) - we appreciate the interest- if you can please ‘reply all’ to this group with (1) the most recent invoice for the waste services as well as (2) a copy of the waste services contract on file, the WM team will initiate the onboarding. 

 

I suspect the onboarding would be completed by Oct 1 but will defer to Dawn and Rebekah on the WM team to confirm the soonest possible date!

 

Thanks again, have a great day.

Hello,

 

It really depends on how bad the situation is.  I’ve seen videos before that show serious infestations, tunnels, 10+ rats just running back and forth with no regard for the driver walking around.  I don’t remember what property that was or I would send you the video I am talking about.

 

It is my understanding that the compactor was serviced, but the driver was making it clear that they needed to make sure to address it, otherwise, he was not going to continue to service it.  It is certainly a safety hazard and should be addressed.

 

Maria is working with dispatch to try to get more information.

Good morning,

I wanted to reach out regarding a concern that was brought to my attention this morning by our Service Manager, Brandon. He informed me that the gentleman collecting trash from our North Tower compactor stated, very sternly, that he would be discontinuing service due to the presence of rodents.

While I understand the concern, I do want to note that Charlotte has been dealing with a widespread rodent issue for quite some time, and this is not unique to our property. This has been a preexisting challenge across multiple communities in our area for well over a year. We have active pest control services with Massey, who continue to assist us with traps, and our team is making every effort to keep the area as clean as possible.

Being told that trash service may be discontinued due to an issue outside of our immediate control feels both unfair and unethical. We cannot afford for trash not to be picked up, especially considering that our maintenance team is also responsible for entering the compactor areas to clean and push out carts.

I have personally inspected the area and can confirm it is not a daily occurrence to see rodents near the compactor. While I regret that this incident may have startled the driver, we are actively taking steps to mitigate the problem and need your partnership to continue service.

Please let me know if this matter was previously communicated to your team, and how we can work together to ensure service is not disrupted. I’ve cc’d Brandon for clarity should you need additional details.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Hi Marlon- the WM team is copied here, they can facilitate the local WM team there in GA (I’m presuming WM operates there) getting you bids.  If WM does not have a local office there, this team can still get bids from other haulers and get the property onboarded to the National WM program.

Hi Annie- it seems that neither of them have matched the service levels the property currently has from WM. Maybe send the below table to them both and ask them to fill in the shaded areas with their respective cost/bid. This will allow an apples to apples comparison and we can negotiate from there if Ts & Cs are onerous.

 

Thanks

Hi Jeff,

 

I received 2 quotes for trash removal.  I am leaning towards Troupe as I walked the site with them, and they are familiar with this area.  The only issue is that they are not willing to go into NetVendor as they do not have the amount of liability insurance required.  Troupe currently has been servicing our client (across the street) for 20+ years.  

 

I am working on having them send the boilerplate agreement, and insurance information from Troupe.

 

How do you feel about these quotes?

 

Thank you,

Sounds great, you could also ask them to send over a boilerplate agreement and I can do the review on the Ts/Cs. They can be a bit onerous.

Hello,

 

We were notified by our local office that due to the ongoing service and safety concerns; they would like to give a 30-day notice.  Our compliance team has also notified us that the property will no longer be able to be on the WM National Account program after that 30 day as well because of the liability issues related to the safety concerns.

 

Prior to our compliance team notifying me that we would no be able to manage the property due to the safety concerns, I had started the process of trying to find another vendor.  However, due to the service constraints (service after 7:30am, traffic, etc) and safety concerns, we were only able to get one vendor to respond.  I’m providing that vendor contact information below, so you can reach out to them for bids.

Hi Annie- I’ll review and circle back shortly, thanks. Given the Troupe can’t meet our requirements, that may make the decision easy or perhaps they can up their coverage levels.

Hi Jeff,

 

I received 2 quotes for trash removal.  I am leaning towards Troupe as I walked the site with them, and they are familiar with this area.  The only issue is that they are not willing to go into NetVendor as they do not have the amount of liability insurance required.  Troupe currently has been servicing our client (across the street) for 20+ years.  

 

I am working on having them send the boilerplate agreement, and insurance information from Troupe.

 

How do you feel about these quotes?

 

Thank you,

Sounds great, you could also ask them to send over a boilerplate agreement and I can do the review on the Ts/Cs. They can be a bit onerous.

Hello,

 

We were notified by our local office that due to the ongoing service and safety concerns; they would like to give a 30-day notice.  Our compliance team has also notified us that the property will no longer be able to be on the WM National Account program after that 30 day as well because of the liability issues related to the safety concerns.

 

Prior to our compliance team notifying me that we would no be able to manage the property due to the safety concerns, I had started the process of trying to find another vendor.  However, due to the service constraints (service after 7:30am, traffic, etc) and safety concerns, we were only able to get one vendor to respond.  I’m providing that vendor contact information below, so you can reach out to them for bids.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] West of Chestnut (GRY014083) - 30 Day Termination Notice

 

Hello,

 

We were notified by our local office that due to the ongoing service and safety concerns; they would like to give a 30-day notice.  Our compliance team has also notified us that the property will no longer be able to be on the WM National Account program after that 30 day as well because of the liability issues related to the safety concerns.

 

Prior to our compliance team notifying me that we would no be able to manage the property due to the safety concerns, I had started the process of trying to find another vendor.  However, due to the service constraints (service after 7:30am, traffic, etc) and safety concerns, we were only able to get one vendor to respond.  I’m providing that vendor contact information below, so you can reach out to them for bids.

The $4,770.00 encompasses the hauls completed in 2025 around the work orders that WM had issued.  That is 18 hauls at $265.00/each.  The disposal charges would not be credited, since those charges are for the trash placed in the compactors.

Good morning Beata,

 

I wanted to pass along some good news.  Republic Services has agreed to provide a $4,770.00 credit for hauls that were performed around the work orders that WM was sending.  Once received, it will be reflected on a future consolidated invoice from WM.  Republic said it will likely issue it at the end of this month.  I have notified our billing dept. so that they make sure the credit is received and passed through.

 

Republic has also confirmed that they updated their system to ensure that service is only scheduled based on the work orders received.  Here is a list of upcoming hauls as an FYI:

 

1000/1040 Bldg - EOW (T)

920 Bldg - E4W (T)

Yes, the one in 1000 building is the more visible and located between the two buildings.

I do not remember if we scheduled the same frequency on both compactors.

 

Thank you again.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

 

I show our vendor team has already reached out to Republic Services this morning.  It may take some time for the research to occur, but I will let you know the outcome.  The reference # for this matter is 90210638.

 

While I have you 😊 is there any chance you can send me a property map showing where the compactors are onsite?  Or let me know details on where they are (i.e. NW side close to  corner of Wake Towne Dr / Wake Forest Rd, East end by Building X, etc.).  If you can also indicate which compactor gets more use / should be on the EOW schedule, and which compactor should be serviced less, I can also add that information in our system.

Hi Dawn,

 

This is super helpful!  No one called Republic Services since we had WM manage the account.

Just before we switched to WM, we worked hard to make those adjustments with Republic Services in order to adhere to the budget.

 

Again, thank you for your time in researching this information.

Hello Beata,

 

I show that we have one compactor on a 1x Every Other Week (Tuesday) schedule, and one compactor on a 1x Every 4 Week (Tuesday) schedule.

 

Upon researching further, we have been requesting hauls as scheduled.  However, Republic is hauling more often than that.  I’ve requested that our Vendor Management team reach out to Republic to find out why they are doing so (i.e. is something contacting them to schedule additional hauls).  If not, we will attempt to dispute the charges with them for those hauls that were not requested by WM.  We cannot guarantee credit, since the agreement is between the property and Republic, but we will certainly try if warranted.  We will also reiterate that they should only be scheduling hauls based on the service work orders sent by WM.

 

Please ensure that your onsite team is reaching out to WM for any service requests and not contacting Republic directly, if that is occurring.  I have attached the customer service guide; page 2 has the 20 most common requests, and the best onsite contact for each.

 

Thanks,

Hi Dawn,

 

We need your help with our waste management account.

Prior to changing over to WM, we agreed on every other week pick up for waste with Republic Services, to save on expenses.  

Looking at the invoice, it is showing a pickup weekly.  Unfortunately, we did not budget for that and no one from Greystar management made those changes.

Can you please give me some insight?

 

Thank you!

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Welcome to WM National Accounts - July 1, 2024 

 

Hello,

 

If you are receiving this email, your property is being transitioned to the Waste Management National Account Program effective July 1st, 2024 under Greystar.  Welcome!  We look forward to working with you.  

 

Your new account number(s) will be:  GRY011271

 

What WM Needs From You:

 

*	Please read the attached documents in their entirety
*	Please note that your corporate office will be paying invoices going forward.  By default, you will receive a copy of the invoice (that says “DO NOT PAY”) at your mgr@greystar.com <mailto:mgr@greystar.com>  email address.  The invoice copies will come from SBSNoReply@wm.com <mailto:SBSNoReply@wm.com> .  If you need the invoice copy to go to another email address or company, such as RealPage or Conservice for tenant bill back purposes, please let me know and I will add them to the distribution list. 
*	If you receive an invoice from the local hauler for services for July, please do not pay, but forward to teamgreystar@wm.com <mailto:teamgreystar@wm.com> , so I can review it and confirm if it should be paid at all.  This will prevent potential duplicate payment issues.
*	If you have outstanding balances from the local hauler (including WM), those will need to be paid directly to them for services prior to July 2024.  If any previous balances are not paid, your services could still be interrupted, so please make sure to resolve any outstanding balances.
*	If you utilize a 3rd party company such as Conservice or RealPage to pay your bills, please notify them of this transition and your new account number.  If you do not notify them, you will get an email from them telling you that your accounts have been canceled.  Your local hauler accounts are being canceled and being replaced by the account number(s) mentioned above.  It is important you share that with Conservice and/or RealPage to avoid confusion.
*	Please print the new customer service contact info and distribute to your staff who will be contacting WM for services.  The contacts are changing with this transition and the new contacts should be used effective July 2024.

 

Highlights of Important Information (We still ask that you read the attachments):

 

*	WM National Accounts bills in arrears.  This means that the July invoice will not bill until around the 15th of the following month.
*	All requests should come through WM National Accounts going forward.
*	Customer Service can be reached at 888-625-5323 or https://chatnow.wmsbs.wm.com <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/chatnow.wmsbs.wm.com__;!!JD2t4ugY8Q!mml_TqL7CR81UHkWRKu-cq-PI-s1vnATJd9b-yB2YiPF7aq7qhIUtRL2VitEWFtXZmgHrIqTtOpvUIr1K6g$> 
*	Your corporate office will be receiving and paying the invoice going forward, you will receive a copy that indicates “DO NOT PAY” on it from SBSNoReply@wm.com <mailto:SBSNoReply@wm.com> .

Hi Dawn,

Thank you for that info!

My RPM had a great idea of having a sensor or scale added to the compactors to monitor the weight.  Do you know if that is something the vendor, Republic services, could add or is it something we would need to provide?

 

 

Thank you again!

The $4,770.00 encompasses the hauls completed in 2025 around the work orders that WM had issued.  That is 18 hauls at $265.00/each.  The disposal charges would not be credited, since those charges are for the trash placed in the compactors.

Good morning Beata,

 

I wanted to pass along some good news.  Republic Services has agreed to provide a $4,770.00 credit for hauls that were performed around the work orders that WM was sending.  Once received, it will be reflected on a future consolidated invoice from WM.  Republic said it will likely issue it at the end of this month.  I have notified our billing dept. so that they make sure the credit is received and passed through.

 

Republic has also confirmed that they updated their system to ensure that service is only scheduled based on the work orders received.  Here is a list of upcoming hauls as an FYI:

 

1000/1040 Bldg - EOW (T)

920 Bldg - E4W (T)

Tuesday, August 26, 2025

If you notice Republic servicing around these dates, make sure to let Team Greystar know right away.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

 

I show our vendor team has already reached out to Republic Services this morning.  It may take some time for the research to occur, but I will let you know the outcome.  The reference # for this matter is 90210638.

 

While I have you 😊 is there any chance you can send me a property map showing where the compactors are onsite?  Or let me know details on where they are (i.e. NW side close to  corner of Wake Towne Dr / Wake Forest Rd, East end by Building X, etc.).  If you can also indicate which compactor gets more use / should be on the EOW schedule, and which compactor should be serviced less, I can also add that information in our system.

Just before we switched to WM, we worked hard to make those adjustments with Republic Services in order to adhere to the budget.

Hello Beata,

 

I show that we have one compactor on a 1x Every Other Week (Tuesday) schedule, and one compactor on a 1x Every 4 Week (Tuesday) schedule.

 

Upon researching further, we have been requesting hauls as scheduled.  However, Republic is hauling more often than that.  I’ve requested that our Vendor Management team reach out to Republic to find out why they are doing so (i.e. is something contacting them to schedule additional hauls).  If not, we will attempt to dispute the charges with them for those hauls that were not requested by WM.  We cannot guarantee credit, since the agreement is between the property and Republic, but we will certainly try if warranted.  We will also reiterate that they should only be scheduling hauls based on the service work orders sent by WM.

 

Please ensure that your onsite team is reaching out to WM for any service requests and not contacting Republic directly, if that is occurring.  I have attached the customer service guide; page 2 has the 20 most common requests, and the best onsite contact for each.

 

Thanks,

Prior to changing over to WM, we agreed on every other week pick up for waste with Republic Services, to save on expenses.  

Looking at the invoice, it is showing a pickup weekly.  Unfortunately, we did not budget for that and no one from Greystar management made those changes.

Can you please give me some insight?

 

Thank you!

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Welcome to WM National Accounts - July 1, 2024 

 

Hello,

 

If you are receiving this email, your property is being transitioned to the Waste Management National Account Program effective July 1st, 2024 under Greystar.  Welcome!  We look forward to working with you.  

 

Your new account number(s) will be:  GRY011271

 

What WM Needs From You:

 

*	Please read the attached documents in their entirety
*	Please note that your corporate office will be paying invoices going forward.  By default, you will receive a copy of the invoice (that says “DO NOT PAY”) at your mgr@greystar.com <mailto:mgr@greystar.com>  email address.  The invoice copies will come from SBSNoReply@wm.com <mailto:SBSNoReply@wm.com> .  If you need the invoice copy to go to another email address or company, such as RealPage or Conservice for tenant bill back purposes, please let me know and I will add them to the distribution list. 
*	If you receive an invoice from the local hauler for services for July, please do not pay, but forward to teamgreystar@wm.com <mailto:teamgreystar@wm.com> , so I can review it and confirm if it should be paid at all.  This will prevent potential duplicate payment issues.
*	If you have outstanding balances from the local hauler (including WM), those will need to be paid directly to them for services prior to July 2024.  If any previous balances are not paid, your services could still be interrupted, so please make sure to resolve any outstanding balances.
*	If you utilize a 3rd party company such as Conservice or RealPage to pay your bills, please notify them of this transition and your new account number.  If you do not notify them, you will get an email from them telling you that your accounts have been canceled.  Your local hauler accounts are being canceled and being replaced by the account number(s) mentioned above.  It is important you share that with Conservice and/or RealPage to avoid confusion.
*	Please print the new customer service contact info and distribute to your staff who will be contacting WM for services.  The contacts are changing with this transition and the new contacts should be used effective July 2024.

 

Highlights of Important Information (We still ask that you read the attachments):

 

*	WM National Accounts bills in arrears.  This means that the July invoice will not bill until around the 15th of the following month.
*	All requests should come through WM National Accounts going forward.
*	Customer Service can be reached at 888-625-5323 or https://chatnow.wmsbs.wm.com <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/chatnow.wmsbs.wm.com__;!!JD2t4ugY8Q!mml_TqL7CR81UHkWRKu-cq-PI-s1vnATJd9b-yB2YiPF7aq7qhIUtRL2VitEWFtXZmgHrIqTtOpvUIr1K6g$> 
*	Your corporate office will be receiving and paying the invoice going forward, you will receive a copy that indicates “DO NOT PAY” on it from SBSNoReply@wm.com <mailto:SBSNoReply@wm.com> .

## Email Content

Thanks Chelsea, we appreciate the feedback

 

@Jones Grant Manager <mailto:jonesgrantmgr@greystar.com>  there is certainly a time savings and convenience factors for this program in addition to possible dollar savings. 

 

Install cost is a 1-time $200 and the monthly monitoring subscription is $150. Greystar properties can cancel at any time. 


Perhaps we go forward with it, work closely with Cheslea and team to get it very dialed in to minimize hauls and maximize weights and measure success in 4-5 months?

 

Please let us know your thoughts!

 

Thanks

Good Morning Team,

 

I just reached out to your Director regarding this location. When we ran a monitor analysis a few months ago, we projected net savings of around $9,000. With the updated schedule, the savings may not reach that level, but having a monitor on your compactor is still valuable—it ensures pickups occur when the compactor is truly at goal. We’ve also seen strong results with locations that have two compactors, as one is typically used much more heavily than the other.

 

Here is the proposal we created for this: https://dsq-technology.revops.io/proposals/5cea53ed-02bf-4129-a0ca-b78671fc6bf8 <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/dsq-technology.revops.io/proposals/5cea53ed-02bf-4129-a0ca-b78671fc6bf8__;!!JD2t4ugY8Q!jeWH9dWcJB3bMwe1G27TsS6GNwjnEpQmEdLmwBSrx-8r4sIyBzbNqITk3GA6q3oTfwM7efApBFpR6UQqNJM$>

Hi Dawn,

Thank you for that info!

My RPM had a great idea of having a sensor or scale added to the compactors to monitor the weight.  Do you know if that is something the vendor, Republic services, could add or is it something we would need to provide?

The $4,770.00 encompasses the hauls completed in 2025 around the work orders that WM had issued.  That is 18 hauls at $265.00/each.  The disposal charges would not be credited, since those charges are for the trash placed in the compactors.

Good morning Beata,

 

I wanted to pass along some good news.  Republic Services has agreed to provide a $4,770.00 credit for hauls that were performed around the work orders that WM was sending.  Once received, it will be reflected on a future consolidated invoice from WM.  Republic said it will likely issue it at the end of this month.  I have notified our billing dept. so that they make sure the credit is received and passed through.

 

Republic has also confirmed that they updated their system to ensure that service is only scheduled based on the work orders received.  Here is a list of upcoming hauls as an FYI:

 

1000/1040 Bldg - EOW (T)

920 Bldg - E4W (T)

Tuesday, August 26, 2025

If you notice Republic servicing around these dates, make sure to let Team Greystar know right away.

The compactor near buildings 1000 / 1040 is on a 1x Every Other Week (Tuesday) schedule.  So it should be emptied tomorrow 7/29 – then next time should be 8/12. 

The compactor near building 920 is only supposed to be serviced 1x Every 4 weeks on Tuesday.  So it should be emptied tomorrow 7/29 – then next time should be 8/26.

Yes, the one in 1000 building is the more visible and located between the two buildings.

I do not remember if we scheduled the same frequency on both compactors.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

 

I show our vendor team has already reached out to Republic Services this morning.  It may take some time for the research to occur, but I will let you know the outcome.  The reference # for this matter is 90210638.

 

While I have you 😊 is there any chance you can send me a property map showing where the compactors are onsite?  Or let me know details on where they are (i.e. NW side close to  corner of Wake Towne Dr / Wake Forest Rd, East end by Building X, etc.).  If you can also indicate which compactor gets more use / should be on the EOW schedule, and which compactor should be serviced less, I can also add that information in our system.

Hi Dawn,

 

This is super helpful!  No one called Republic Services since we had WM manage the account.

Just before we switched to WM, we worked hard to make those adjustments with Republic Services in order to adhere to the budget.

 

Again, thank you for your time in researching this information.

Hello Beata,

 

I show that we have one compactor on a 1x Every Other Week (Tuesday) schedule, and one compactor on a 1x Every 4 Week (Tuesday) schedule.

 

Upon researching further, we have been requesting hauls as scheduled.  However, Republic is hauling more often than that.  I’ve requested that our Vendor Management team reach out to Republic to find out why they are doing so (i.e. is something contacting them to schedule additional hauls).  If not, we will attempt to dispute the charges with them for those hauls that were not requested by WM.  We cannot guarantee credit, since the agreement is between the property and Republic, but we will certainly try if warranted.  We will also reiterate that they should only be scheduling hauls based on the service work orders sent by WM.

 

Please ensure that your onsite team is reaching out to WM for any service requests and not contacting Republic directly, if that is occurring.  I have attached the customer service guide; page 2 has the 20 most common requests, and the best onsite contact for each.

 

Thanks,

Hi Dawn,

 

We need your help with our waste management account.

Prior to changing over to WM, we agreed on every other week pick up for waste with Republic Services, to save on expenses.  

Looking at the invoice, it is showing a pickup weekly.  Unfortunately, we did not budget for that and no one from Greystar management made those changes.

Can you please give me some insight?

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Welcome to WM National Accounts - July 1, 2024

 

Hello,

 

If you are receiving this email, your property is being transitioned to the Waste Management National Account Program effective July 1st, 2024 under Greystar.  Welcome!  We look forward to working with you. 

 

Your new account number(s) will be:  GRY011271

 

What WM Needs From You:

 

*	Please read the attached documents in their entirety
*	Please note that your corporate office will be paying invoices going forward.  By default, you will receive a copy of the invoice (that says “DO NOT PAY”) at your mgr@greystar.com <mailto:mgr@greystar.com>  email address.  The invoice copies will come from SBSNoReply@wm.com <mailto:SBSNoReply@wm.com> .  If you need the invoice copy to go to another email address or company, such as RealPage or Conservice for tenant bill back purposes, please let me know and I will add them to the distribution list.
*	If you receive an invoice from the local hauler for services for July, please do not pay, but forward to teamgreystar@wm.com <mailto:teamgreystar@wm.com> , so I can review it and confirm if it should be paid at all.  This will prevent potential duplicate payment issues.
*	If you have outstanding balances from the local hauler (including WM), those will need to be paid directly to them for services prior to July 2024.  If any previous balances are not paid, your services could still be interrupted, so please make sure to resolve any outstanding balances.
*	If you utilize a 3rd party company such as Conservice or RealPage to pay your bills, please notify them of this transition and your new account number.  If you do not notify them, you will get an email from them telling you that your accounts have been canceled.  Your local hauler accounts are being canceled and being replaced by the account number(s) mentioned above.  It is important you share that with Conservice and/or RealPage to avoid confusion.
*	Please print the new customer service contact info and distribute to your staff who will be contacting WM for services.  The contacts are changing with this transition and the new contacts should be used effective July 2024.

 

Highlights of Important Information (We still ask that you read the attachments):

 

*	WM National Accounts bills in arrears.  This means that the July invoice will not bill until around the 15th of the following month.
*	All requests should come through WM National Accounts going forward.
*	Customer Service can be reached at 888-625-5323 or https://chatnow.wmsbs.wm.com <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/chatnow.wmsbs.wm.com__;!!JD2t4ugY8Q!mml_TqL7CR81UHkWRKu-cq-PI-s1vnATJd9b-yB2YiPF7aq7qhIUtRL2VitEWFtXZmgHrIqTtOpvUIr1K6g$> 
*	Your corporate office will be receiving and paying the invoice going forward, you will receive a copy that indicates “DO NOT PAY” on it from SBSNoReply@wm.com <mailto:SBSNoReply@wm.com> .

Ok- there is some confusion and/or I may need to insert myself into getting the property with right equipment/containers as they lease up.

 

*	Is WM renting the actual compactor unit?
*	Is it vertical or apartment style?
*	What all is listed as equipment currently on rent if from WM?
*	They are getting a waste caddy- who is going to supply the brackets for towing?

Thanks for helping get this sorted!

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

Hello Julian,

 

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

Good morning Dawn. Just wanting to check in on the status of the 4yd container replacement. WM dropped off a 2yd container without notice and damaged the building. Please see attached photo of 2yd container as requested. Thank you.

Yes, going forward your 2-4yd trash and 1-2yd trash will be serviced on Tuesdays and Fridays.  And I will check in bi-weekly with an update on when we’ll be able to replace the 2yd with a 4yd.

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.  

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

$335.00 lease

 

Above rates do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Please let me know approval ASAP so that I can get the changes processed.  I will keep you updated on the ETA on the return of the 2yd compactor bin, and also the status on if we can get another 4yd provided.

 

Thanks,

Importance: High

 

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Hi Melissa,

 

Do you have the back up invoices for Trash? We seem to be all over the place. The last billback amount was $7,811 and a few months ago was $6,243. It makes figuring out what to budget tough.

## Email Content

Hi there Jeremy- with the wide and sweeping variety of waste hauler contracts our assets have,  I do not believe any corporate guidance has been given for budget assumptions. 

 

For properties on our WM National program, the annual increase guidance is generally around 5%. There are some slight variations of contract terms with WM that might very 1%-2%. 

 

For those not on the WM program, I’d encourage a review of the waste contract the property has with the local hauler. And even chat with their local waste rep to negotiate, there is usually some horse trading that can be done depending on the hauler and the contract lifecycle.

 

Thanks for checking on this, I wish I had more definitive guidance for you.

Ok- there is some confusion and/or I may need to insert myself into getting the property with right equipment/containers as they lease up.

 

*	Is WM renting the actual compactor unit?
*	Is it vertical or apartment style?
*	What all is listed as equipment currently on rent if from WM?
*	They are getting a waste caddy- who is going to supply the brackets for towing?

Thanks for helping get this sorted!

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

 

Thanks,

Hello Julian,

 

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

$335.00 lease

 

Above rates do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Please let me know approval ASAP so that I can get the changes processed.  I will keep you updated on the ETA on the return of the 2yd compactor bin, and also the status on if we can get another 4yd provided.

 

Thanks,

Subject: RE: Greystar - Mira GRY020220 | Trash Compactor Service 
Importance: High

 

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

Hello Julian,

 

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

$335.00 lease

 

Above rates do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Please let me know approval ASAP so that I can get the changes processed.  I will keep you updated on the ETA on the return of the 2yd compactor bin, and also the status on if we can get another 4yd provided.

 

Thanks,

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Hi Marcos, hope you had a nice weekend. 

Aventura Decatur is on the WM program,  @Alison Green <mailto:alison.green@greystar.com>  can help troubleshoot why it may not be showing up as compliant.

 

Thanks much, in taking a 1st look at this property, the waste expenses/door are well above national averages, this one is about $22/door/month which is closer to California costs! 

 

I see the client is Boston Capital, if you think there is merit in us doing a portfolio review for BC, could you let me know and if there are others to include in this discussion, let’s also pull them in!

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

 

Thank you,

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

$335.00 lease

 

Above rates do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Please let me know approval ASAP so that I can get the changes processed.  I will keep you updated on the ETA on the return of the 2yd compactor bin, and also the status on if we can get another 4yd provided.

 

Thanks,

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

Hello Julian,

 

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

 

Thanks,

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.  

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

$335.00 lease

 

Above rates do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Please let me know approval ASAP so that I can get the changes processed.  I will keep you updated on the ETA on the return of the 2yd compactor bin, and also the status on if we can get another 4yd provided.

 

Thanks,

Importance: High

 

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Hi Jeff,

 

I received 2 quotes for trash removal.  I am leaning towards Troupe as I walked the site with them, and they are familiar with this area.  The only issue is that they are not willing to go into NetVendor as they do not have the amount of liability insurance required.  Troupe currently has been servicing our client (across the street) for 20+ years.  

 

I am working on having them send the boilerplate agreement, and insurance information from Troupe.

 

How do you feel about these quotes?

 

Thank you,

Sounds great, you could also ask them to send over a boilerplate agreement and I can do the review on the Ts/Cs. They can be a bit onerous.

Hello,

 

We were notified by our local office that due to the ongoing service and safety concerns; they would like to give a 30-day notice.  Our compliance team has also notified us that the property will no longer be able to be on the WM National Account program after that 30 day as well because of the liability issues related to the safety concerns.

 

Prior to our compliance team notifying me that we would no be able to manage the property due to the safety concerns, I had started the process of trying to find another vendor.  However, due to the service constraints (service after 7:30am, traffic, etc) and safety concerns, we were only able to get one vendor to respond.  I’m providing that vendor contact information below, so you can reach out to them for bids.

Hello Everyone,

*	Element Caroline Bay has an estimated savings of $20k. Proposal here: https://dsq-technology.revops.io/proposals/32cd5f08-8573-4b20-8a1c-40fab5d2d68e <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/dsq-technology.revops.io/proposals/32cd5f08-8573-4b20-8a1c-40fab5d2d68e__;!!JD2t4ugY8Q!n3ugmOPE_oqtPmRY7qn4zxYDJtelRVlwwT4_cNmTzoWx1r0eUf4wuk7f8gcUtcUpzd2cnZ0_e8WKVi-f_yg3qN4$> 
*	Atlantic at Parkridge currently has some solid tonnage and with haul rate baked into the disposal there is currently no savings. 
*	The Burke only has one month of data, I would like to see three if possible to prior to suggesting a monitor or not.


If I have your written approval, I can go to Conservice & ask for invoices for Broadstone Ingleside.

Thank you,
Chelsea

Ok- there is some confusion and/or I may need to insert myself into getting the property with right equipment/containers as they lease up.

 

*	Is WM renting the actual compactor unit?
*	Is it vertical or apartment style?
*	What all is listed as equipment currently on rent if from WM?

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

 

Thanks,

Hello Julian,

 

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

Subject: RE: Greystar - Mira GRY020220 | Trash Compactor Service 
Importance: High

 

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Hi Carlos,

 

I’m attaching the customer service guide for national accounts.  Please make sure you are utilizing the attached contacts, otherwise, ultimately your request can be delayed.  Our local offices do not have access to make changes to WM National Accounts and ultimately route the requests to WM National Accounts for processing.  WM National Accounts would then have to validate the request before processing, since we didn’t receive the request directly.


This can all be circumvented by your team contacting WM National Accounts.   Account # GRY016215

As you know, we will not know if these dumpsters will be empty. Or, which location they will be at on day of service. He can work on the ones that are empty. Work on the others on a later date. We can provide a hose and buckets of water if need be. Also, Miguel will be back and he can assist when needed. He can move dumpsters wherever your tech wants. Currently these dumpsters are at A, B buildings and at the enclosure.

Good morning Carlos and Kate,

 

We’re currently fabricating the additional eight tow rods as requested. These are scheduled to be completed by close of business Thursday. Once ready, we’ll dispatch our technician to your site for installation.

 

To ensure safety and efficiency, please make sure all bins are emptied prior to installation to eliminate any fire risk. Additionally, all bins must be grouped together in a single location.

 

We’re looking at possible installation dates of next Monday (following recycling service) AND next Tuesday (after trash service). Carlos, would either of these dates work for you? Just a reminder—you’ll need to have all bins consolidated in one spot for our technician.

 

Kate, when you have a moment, please give me a call on my cell: 916-350-0479.

Hello,

 

I’ve attached four invoices.  You will find that this particular invoice included several months of invoicing.  It was catching up on invoicing that had not yet been billed.

 

WM does not bill the property until we receive and process payment to the franchise vendor, GFL.

Hi Richard,

 

My RPM, Brianna, gave me your contact information and we were hoping you would be able to assist us on a question regarding a support fee we are seeing from Waste Management which is higher than usual and hitting our August financials. Please see below.

 



 

Any thoughts on where this increase compared to previous months is coming from? May's support fee here was only $1,500, for reference.

Hi Rebekah/Dawn- I’d like to use this thread as the starting point to coordinate the removal of WM containers and the delivery of the new hauler’s containers. 

Can you please coordinate with the local WM team and confirm the day and time WM will be removing their containers? Will it be in one load or several loads within the same day?

Thanks much,

Jeff

Hi Annie- Troupe has good terms, you seem comfortable holding them accountable to good service standards and we would just need to ensure they coordinate with WM during the transition. Troupe should be bringing containers in on the same day that WM is removing theirs.  They will need to match the current service levels for container sizes and frequencies. 

 

I am not the proper person to review or comment on insurance levels and compliance with our requirements. 

 

I would suggest this edit: 

RATE ADJUSTMENTS. 1 yr lock, 5% cap year 2&3. Disposal increase allowed with written proof of increase from facility. This disposal increase would only apply for facilities NOT owned or operated by Troupe and shall not exceed the 5% cap at any time during the initial or subsequent contract terms.

 

That provides an added protection.

 

Thanks Annie, I’ll get an email going with WM relative to the transition.

 

Enjoy your break!!

Hi Jeff,

 

I received 2 quotes for trash removal.  I am leaning towards Troupe as I walked the site with them, and they are familiar with this area.  The only issue is that they are not willing to go into NetVendor as they do not have the amount of liability insurance required.  Troupe currently has been servicing our client (across the street) for 20+ years.  

 

I am working on having them send the boilerplate agreement, and insurance information from Troupe.

 

How do you feel about these quotes?

 

Thank you,

Sounds great, you could also ask them to send over a boilerplate agreement and I can do the review on the Ts/Cs. They can be a bit onerous.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] West of Chestnut (GRY014083) - 30 Day Termination Notice

 

Hello,

 

We were notified by our local office that due to the ongoing service and safety concerns; they would like to give a 30-day notice.  Our compliance team has also notified us that the property will no longer be able to be on the WM National Account program after that 30 day as well because of the liability issues related to the safety concerns.

 

Prior to our compliance team notifying me that we would no be able to manage the property due to the safety concerns, I had started the process of trying to find another vendor.  However, due to the service constraints (service after 7:30am, traffic, etc) and safety concerns, we were only able to get one vendor to respond.  I’m providing that vendor contact information below, so you can reach out to them for bids.

Hi Rebekah/Dawn- I’d like to use this thread as the starting point to coordinate the removal of WM containers and the delivery of the new hauler’s containers. 

Can you please coordinate with the local WM team and confirm the day and time WM will be removing their containers? Will it be in one load or several loads within the same day?

Thanks much,

Jeff
