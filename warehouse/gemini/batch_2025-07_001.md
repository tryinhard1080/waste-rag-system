Thanks Dawn, we’ll keep an eye on this and imagine the property providing the W9 will be no problem.

Hello Christopher,

 

We are continuing to work with the City to get the billing change completed.  They are now saying that they are unable to change the billing address until they have a copy of the property’s W-9 form for their records.  Part of the delay is because they still have this under Wood Partners.  They will only make the update if they receive the W-9 for your property under Greystar.  I’m looping in Jeff/Richard under @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  as well in case their assistance is needed.

 

Are you able to provide this ASAP?  

 

Thanks,

From talking to Conservice what billing they have received does have the wrong address on it. It has our property address and not the address for conservice. Also, what they have received to date is very small amounts and I have attached a copy of one of the invoices. They say on them do not pay. They have not received anything for monthly billing as you would expect. I do not have access to the city billing portal as do not handle the processing here on site. I did ask Conservice if they do and they said they do not.

Good morning Chris,

 

I am terribly sorry for the delayed response.  Question – were you drafted from Conservice or paid them directly for January and February?

 

We are finally getting somewhere with the City of Georgetown.  They have sent over the April invoice, which appears to have a past due balance for March only.  Do you have access to the city billing portal by any chance?   If you have any way to access the invoices to send over to me, that would be a huge help.  If not, no worries – our vendor team is following up with the City daily asking for all unpaid invoices.  I am also following up with our team to ensure they are doing their due diligence to obtain them, and also confirm that the City has finally updated the billing address as they should have originally.

 

I will be sure to notify you when we have this matter resolved.

 

Thank you,

Hello Chris,

 

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Our Vendor Management team has been reaching out to the City of Georgetown for outstanding invoices.  Are you able to confirm if you have received anything from them?  The remit address previously was WOOD PARTNERS 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN TX 78633. 

 

I have escalated this further, but if you did receive any invoices, please send them over ASAP.

I was given your email as our rep for our account. If this is correct thank you and if not can you possibly guide me in the direction of whom that might be.

I am assuming because of the holiday why no service yesterday and checking to see if that service will be today instead?

When I looked previously, there was a lack of data on Notting Hill that I’m double checking on now. I’ll get back to you by EOD with confirmation on what’s possible with that asset. 

 

Neither Elan nor Maggie are on the WM national program which makes analyzing opportunities challenging. Could you send along recent waste invoices for each of those properties and I can do a manual assessment?

 

Thanks- I promise this won’t get by me again!

Hi Lisa, good morning-  if you can give me the name of each property for the tilt sensors and which one you have in mind for Optimize, I will provide you with some guidance. With the tilt sensor offering being very early stage, I’ll likely have a few questions for you on those properties!

Thanks much

Good morning!

 

I have a property I would like to look into adding the tilt sensors for my properties that have compactor bins vs. large compactors pulled by Waste Management.  Can you give me the cost of adding this?

 

I also have a property that I would like to look at adding Optimize to the compactor.  Can you give me the next steps?

I’ve proposed a team call for later today and assured them Casellas has been provided notice, correct?

The team is not prepared to have the WM containers dropped off at this time. We have not noticed Cassella of this change and would need to coordinate with them as to the switch. We will need to review the expired contract to determine any carryover terms and if a 30 day notice is appropriate. I see that WM did notify the site team back in May, but this communication was overlooked. With that WM never received confirmation ahead of attempting delivery of nine dumpsters. This may be an opportunity for them in the future. 

 

Please pass along any pertinent agreements for WM, and I will review and get executed accordingly. The team will work with WM and Casella to arrange a seamless transition. Given the volume of trash this property produces, we cannot have any lapse in a dumpster being onsite.

Understood, your team can certainly keep WM on a short leash with service expectations and there is a 30-day out by design in the event they want to switch back to Casella. 

 

The ~$2k annual savings aside, the local WM team is expected to deliver as part of this transition and we’ve got a process in place if they don’t.

 

They are working on getting the containers in place asap to avoid any holiday mishaps. Is the property team prepared to allow WM to bring containers in? Maybe this is already done but last I heard, the property rejected the WM containers.

 

Thanks Evan,

Hi Evan- I don’t believe we’ve met and wanted to offer any support or guidance that I can. The process laid out is SOP and the earlier communication was put in place for the property to have the opportunity to retain whomever they choose at the end of a particular contract.

Hi Evan,

 

The Casella agreement expired on 5/30/25.  Once agreements expire, it is normal for WM to move the service to WM, where we can better control the services being provided.  The rates are not changing from what was being billed by Casella, but you would switch to the Greystar/WM terms that includes a 1 year with 1 year auto-renewal and 30 day out for lost/sold properties.  We can provide the new agreement once the change has been completed.

 

We did notify the property of this change back on May 28th and asked that they let us know if there were any questions related to the transition (email included at bottom of email chain).

 

Please let us know if we should move forward with this transition and have the WM containers re-delivered.  Casella should be removing their containers today as well.

 

Thanks,

## Email Content

Ok, perhaps we get a team call on the calendar for later today with WM and talk through these items to double-ensure things go smoothly. Does this sound good?

 

I’m certain Casella was provided appropriate notice but let’s get the details from the WM team.

 

**If this team can please update your calendars, I’ll coordinate a time for us to chat.

 

Thanks all,

The team is not prepared to have the WM containers dropped off at this time. We have not noticed Cassella of this change and would need to coordinate with them as to the switch. We will need to review the expired contract to determine any carryover terms and if a 30 day notice is appropriate. I see that WM did notify the site team back in May, but this communication was overlooked. With that WM never received confirmation ahead of attempting delivery of nine dumpsters. This may be an opportunity for them in the future. 

 

Please pass along any pertinent agreements for WM, and I will review and get executed accordingly. The team will work with WM and Casella to arrange a seamless transition. Given the volume of trash this property produces, we cannot have any lapse in a dumpster being onsite.

Understood, your team can certainly keep WM on a short leash with service expectations and there is a 30-day out by design in the event they want to switch back to Casella. 

 

The ~$2k annual savings aside, the local WM team is expected to deliver as part of this transition and we’ve got a process in place if they don’t.

 

They are working on getting the containers in place asap to avoid any holiday mishaps. Is the property team prepared to allow WM to bring containers in? Maybe this is already done but last I heard, the property rejected the WM containers.

 

Thanks Evan,

We have been pleased with Cassella’s performance at the site. We have had a history of issues with other vendors at this site specifically, so we are apprehensive to switch vendors and upend the relationship with Cassella.

Hi Evan- I don’t believe we’ve met and wanted to offer any support or guidance that I can. The process laid out is SOP and the earlier communication was put in place for the property to have the opportunity to retain whomever they choose at the end of a particular contract.

Hi Evan,

 

The Casella agreement expired on 5/30/25.  Once agreements expire, it is normal for WM to move the service to WM, where we can better control the services being provided.  The rates are not changing from what was being billed by Casella, but you would switch to the Greystar/WM terms that includes a 1 year with 1 year auto-renewal and 30 day out for lost/sold properties.  We can provide the new agreement once the change has been completed.

 

We did notify the property of this change back on May 28th and asked that they let us know if there were any questions related to the transition (email included at bottom of email chain).

 

Please let us know if we should move forward with this transition and have the WM containers re-delivered.  Casella should be removing their containers today as well.

 

Thanks,

## Email Content

Understood, your team can certainly keep WM on a short leash with service expectations and there is a 30-day out by design in the event they want to switch back to Casella. 

 

The ~$2k annual savings aside, the local WM team is expected to deliver as part of this transition and we’ve got a process in place if they don’t.

 

They are working on getting the containers in place asap to avoid any holiday mishaps. Is the property team prepared to allow WM to bring containers in? Maybe this is already done but last I heard, the property rejected the WM containers.

 

Thanks Evan,

We have been pleased with Cassella’s performance at the site. We have had a history of issues with other vendors at this site specifically, so we are apprehensive to switch vendors and upend the relationship with Cassella.

Hi Evan,

 

The Casella agreement expired on 5/30/25.  Once agreements expire, it is normal for WM to move the service to WM, where we can better control the services being provided.  The rates are not changing from what was being billed by Casella, but you would switch to the Greystar/WM terms that includes a 1 year with 1 year auto-renewal and 30 day out for lost/sold properties.  We can provide the new agreement once the change has been completed.

 

We did notify the property of this change back on May 28th and asked that they let us know if there were any questions related to the transition (email included at bottom of email chain).

 

Please let us know if we should move forward with this transition and have the WM containers re-delivered.  Casella should be removing their containers today as well.

 

Thanks,

Hi Olivia- I had sent this previously and WM is ready for your direction to get services set up at The Lana!

The item to take note of is the need for a waste caddy due to the slope coming out of the garage which will require the waste bins to have brackets on them which Athens (local waste hauler) can provide.

Thanks, I’m happy to review details with the site team on a call if that’s easier.

Hi Team,

Looking to engage Waste Management at Lana. Anticipated TCO date is 5/19. Can we get a head start on setting up an account for service? The service address is 10375 Washington Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232. There is no trash compactor, 139 units, and I will pass along building plans as soon as they are made available to me.

Thank you,

Hi Trudy- this is likely just a timing issue, there have been a few others in the same situation and the Mighty90s team has assured us it will update in July.

 

Thanks Trudy, if you notice it’s not getting captured, let’s reconnect next month and we’ll troubleshoot.

Hi Trudy- this is likely just a timing issue, there have been a few others in the same situation and the Mighty90s team has assured us it will update in July.

 

Thanks Trudy, if you notice it’s not getting captured, let’s reconnect next month and we’ll troubleshoot.

Wondering if our property has been corrected to be under the Greystar contract now? I am showing non-compliant for Mighty 90's and need to get this corrected. I've attached the contract we submitted in September 2024.

Hi Olivia- I had sent this previously and WM is ready for your direction to get services set up at The Lana!

The item to take note of is the need for a waste caddy due to the slope coming out of the garage which will require the waste bins to have brackets on them which Athens (local waste hauler) can provide.

Thanks, I’m happy to review details with the site team on a call if that’s easier.

Hi Team,

Looking to engage Waste Management at Lana. Anticipated TCO date is 5/19. Can we get a head start on setting up an account for service? The service address is 10375 Washington Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232. There is no trash compactor, 139 units, and I will pass along building plans as soon as they are made available to me.

Thank you,

WM:

1-34yd SC 1x/wk on Friday - $519.16/month rental, $169.40/haul, $71.90/ton – They are averaging less than 2 tons and really should look into having a monitor

1-8yd 3x/wk MThSa $764.09

1-8yd 3x/wk MThSa $598.76

 

To remove the compactor, it would be $500.  There are still two 8yd bins on site, pictured below.  Removal of those will be $75 per container.

Hi Jeff,

 

Not sure what you want to do here.  The compactor has already been repaired and returned to the property, we are waiting for response from the property on removing the opentop.  

 

Just to reiterate, the only thing we were not being helpful about was crediting the rental while the compactor is down.  That is not something we do.  We did however, reduce the charges of the opentop tremendously, and make sure the services were happening that needed to happen.

 

Do you want us to get quotes from third party providers?

Hi Jeff,

 

We can look at this on Monday and come up with a plan.  Dawn did a great job of laying out what we did exactly.  I just gave a high-level response to Christina when she was asking for us to waive rental on the compactor.  

 

We do not do that, we do discount the opentop, even though it’s not contractual.  Because I would not waive the rental fees of the compactor as well, they are saying we are not cooperating, which you can see is not the case.

 

Thanks,

Hi Dawn- I see that, yes and it should be conveyed to Christina and perhaps on the tail end of the email where she is requesting a copy of the contract.  You and RM can loop in to engage with her directly.

Morning Jeff,

 

Has Christina conveyed why she believes WM is not working with them on this matter?

 

Just some food for thought…

 

The property reported the compactor down on 6/4.  The tech was onsite with 24 hours, and the original reported matter was resolved (it wasn’t compacting).  From what I understand, staff also noted there was an issue with the rollers.  Local Ops let the repair team know on 6/5 that the compactor needed to be brought in to the shop in order to fix that specific issue.  The compactor was picked up on 6/9 and last note from the shop was that it should be repaired early next week.  The ETA on the return of the equipment was communicated to the Property Manager on 6/10 – so one day after the compactor was removed.

 

A temporary OT was delivered on 6/6.  The local division was actually cutoff for deliveries until 6/10, but Team Greystar was able to push the urgency and get it delivered before the weekend.  The typical cost for a temp 30Y OT in this area would be $75.00 delivery, $450.00 haul, $71.90 disposal/ton, $90.00 monthly rental.  With Greystar, even though we are not contractually obligated, we discount the costs when this property’s WM compactor equipment is down to $0.00 delivery, $125.00 haul, $71.90 disposal/ton, $0.00 monthly rental.  

 

Rebekah is taking a much-deserved day off, but I’m sure she’ll chime in further on Monday.  If we can get some insight on what the specific concern is, so that we are better able to respond, it would be appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Hi Christina- if there is anything I can help with in terms of guidance or seeking a compactor replacement, please let me know. The rate WM is providing is close to market rates and we have 2 Recommended Suppliers that can provide quotes for new units if you want to shop around and/or get new rental equipment.

Hi Christina,

 

I have requested that our repair team provide you with an update on the repairs.  

 

The compactor rental is $519.16.

 

We do not provide credit on rentals when a compactor is down.  It would be similar to a leased vehicle breaking down and being put in the shop, you would still have to pay your monthly lease while it is in the shop.

 

WM is discounting the opentop.  That is also not a common practice, or required by our contract, but something we do as a courtesy to Greystar.

 

Thanks,

How much is the compactor monthly? 

 

We also reported the wheels are broken from the driver. Do we have a lead time for the compactor repairs? My client is confused on why we are paying for something that is down… we should not have to pay for that being down, even with the discounted rate of the roll off.

 

Also – what is our term on our national contract?

Hi Christina

 

The repair team should be in contact with you shorty with an ETA for the tech.  They will be the ones to determine if the compactor is repairable. 

 

The roll off will bill at the discounted rates . 

 

The compactor will still bill for the monthly rental.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions

And to confirm Karen, we wont be paying for the compactor while this repair is happening? Just want to be sure we are just paying for the roll off at the discounted rate while the repair is happening. 

 

Do we have a timeframe for the repair? Does it have to be repaired versus replaced? Just want to be sure this is going to be done timely.

HI Brit’knie

 

When the repair team contacts you with the ETA please make sure you mention to them about the wheels on the compactor.

 

In addition, are you needing the roll off delivered due to the compactor being down, is that correct?

 

I will ask for pricing form the local division on the roll off as I do believe there should be special pricing on the roll off due to the compactor being WM owned.

 

I will provide the that cost as soon as possible.

	Hi Mark,

	An RFP from Greystar for valet services went out this morning, and I wanted to reach out to see if there’s anything we can do to ensure CCS received that RFP and is considered. We have completed the supplier partnership and consideration forms, but please let me know if there’s anything else needed on our end to make sure we receive the RFP.

	CCS currently supports a large footprint for Greystar across the Southeast and would truly appreciate the opportunity to participate. As of December 2024, we were servicing 20,588 of your doors 5 to 7 nights a week.

	We’re also on pace to service over 100,000 dryer vents this year, with 15,000–20,000 of those at Greystar communities. We’ve worked closely with your teams in the Southeast, served as a long-time vendor sponsor, and are always proud to support local efforts, including fundraisers and community events.

	Thank you for your time and consideration—I look forward to hearing from you.

	Thank you,

				Hello Mark,

				I hope you're doing well. My name is Nathan Sedlak, and I’m with Community Concierge Services in Charlotte, N.C. We provide door to door trash service, pressure washing, dryer vent cleaning, gutter cleaning, and fireplace/chimney cleaning.  

				I was given your contact information by Phil McRae and wanted to reach out to see if CCS could carve out some time to meet with you. CCS has worked with Greystar mainly in the southeast but does serve other communities in other areas throughout the US. In December of 2024 we were servicing 20,588 of your doors 5 or 7 nights a week with our valet trash service. A lot of those are under the Greystar 12 month agreement. CCS is on pace this year to service over 100k dryer vents. 15 to 20k will be with Greystar communities. I have worked closely with the teams in the southeast and have been a vendor sponsor for a long time. CCS also contributes to the local teams through fundraisers and other ways we can be involved. I worked for Greystar Charlotte as a maintenance supervisor for 10 years. We have a great relationship with the team there and wanted to see if there was an opportunity to expand on that. I would love the opportunity to explore how we may be able to do that with you or just introduce CCS to you. 

				Would you be open to a quick call next week to discuss possible needs or just have an introduction? I would have one of the CCS partners with me. Let us know what works best for you—I’d be happy to accommodate your schedule.

				Looking forward to connecting!

Hi Olivia- I had sent this previously and WM is ready for your direction to get services set up at The Lana!

The item to take note of is the need for a waste caddy due to the slope coming out of the garage which will require the waste bins to have brackets on them which Athens (local waste hauler) can provide.

Thanks, I’m happy to review details with the site team on a call if that’s easier.

Hi Team,

Looking to engage Waste Management at Lana. Anticipated TCO date is 5/19. Can we get a head start on setting up an account for service? The service address is 10375 Washington Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232. There is no trash compactor, 139 units, and I will pass along building plans as soon as they are made available to me.

Thank you,

Hi Olivia- I had sent this previously and WM is ready for your direction to get services set up at The Lana!

The item to take note of is the need for a waste caddy due to the slope coming out of the garage which will require the waste bins to have brackets on them which Athens (local waste hauler) can provide.

Thanks, I’m happy to review details with the site team on a call if that’s easier.

Hi Team,

Looking to engage Waste Management at Lana. Anticipated TCO date is 5/19. Can we get a head start on setting up an account for service? The service address is 10375 Washington Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232. There is no trash compactor, 139 units, and I will pass along building plans as soon as they are made available to me.

Thank you,

It looks like you only selected a bid from Tower.  If you are seeking multiple bids from Tower and CRA you'll have to select each one in the form. If you only intended to get a bid from Tower that did go through and they should reach out to you soon.

## Email Content

Hi Marco- I have a copy of your request and see that you’re looking to purchase bins and Tower Compactor was selected. Tower is one of our great Suppliers and Compactor Rentals of America (CRA) is the other. 

 

When it comes to purchasing (not renting), CRA typically has the lower price and shorter lead times. If you can confirm you’re in fact after a purchase arrangement, I can connect you direct to Dani at CRA, she’s very helpful. If you’re getting 2 yard bins, cost should be roughly $3400+shipping for each. 

 

Thanks Marco,

Our asset Manager Gabriela with PGIM asked me for a copy of our latest invoice. I know Vector is associated with PGIM, last time they asked we forwarded the request Waste Management provided us and Gabriela said it was for a different PGIM property. Could this be the case? I did not see the attachment come through.

Hi Jaymi- I don’t’ believe we’ve had the chance to meet and wanted to check in on the request from a broker that is attached. I believe this is one of your properties. Because this property is on our Greystar National Program with WM, they will not respond to brokers due to a conflict of interest, conditions of our Supplier agreement  and frequent uncertainty of who’s who relative to giving out pricing and service information.

 

Are you aware of what Vector is trying to accomplish with this request?

 

I can try to facilitate some exchange of billing information if I can understand things a bit more. Glad to have a quick chat with you if that’s easier!

Hi Lisa-this one slipped by us, my apologies!

When I looked previously, there was a lack of data on Notting Hill that I’m double checking on now. I’ll get back to you by EOD with confirmation on what’s possible with that asset. 

 

Neither Elan nor Maggie are on the WM national program which makes analyzing opportunities challenging. Could you send along recent waste invoices for each of those properties and I can do a manual assessment?

## Email Content

Hi Jaymi- I don’t’ believe we’ve had the chance to meet and wanted to check in on the request from a broker that is attached. I believe this is one of your properties. Because this property is on our Greystar National Program with WM, they will not respond to brokers due to a conflict of interest, conditions of our Supplier agreement  and frequent uncertainty of who’s who relative to giving out pricing and service information.

 

Are you aware of what Vector is trying to accomplish with this request?

 

I can try to facilitate some exchange of billing information if I can understand things a bit more. Glad to have a quick chat with you if that’s easier!

 

Thanks Jaymi,

Hi!

 

I am reaching out as Mission Grove was selected to undergo data verification for their 2024 waste consumption in Energy Star Portfolio Manager.  For this, I was hoping you would be able to share some evidence (such as waste invoices, diversion reports, calculations, etc.) that show the methodology behind entering the landfill waste, compost, and recycling quantities for 2024?

 

We are hoping to complete the above request ASAP, so please do not hesitate to reach out if any clarification is needed.

Hi Jack- This asset is on the Greystar waste program, I’ve attached the full-year invoicing. Waste data is pushed into ESPM each month with conversion factors and ratios aligning with EPA standards for multi-family waste streams. This is specific for converting volume to weight and extrapolating frequency of pick-ups using 4.33 weeks/month. Additionally, the calculations are based on each container being full at time of pick up when actual weights are not recorded at the landfill or MRF. 

 

Mission Grove is located within a Franchised market for waste services where municipalities manage most aspects of collection programs and the specific hauler(s).

 

Hope this helps, if there are more questions, please reach out anytime!

 

Thanks

Hi!

 

I am reaching out as Mission Grove was selected to undergo data verification for their 2024 waste consumption in Energy Star Portfolio Manager.  For this, I was hoping you would be able to share some evidence (such as waste invoices, diversion reports, calculations, etc.) that show the methodology behind entering the landfill waste, compost, and recycling quantities for 2024?

 

We are hoping to complete the above request ASAP, so please do not hesitate to reach out if any clarification is needed.

Hey there- Can you please send over invoices from 2024. 

 

Could you also give this a 1st pass, it’s close to $35/door/month which is quite high even for CA.

Hey WM team- the driver returned and may have pinched a hose or something else has caused the compactor to have a good size hydraulic leak. Can we get someone on it asap please?

The compactor would not allow anymore trash in the phase II compactor.  Therefore, piles of trash were being left on the ground.  Maintenance tried to put it in but it would not compact any more.

Good Morning Lori!

Looks like the compactor got picked up at 3.84 tons yesterday. Typically a 34 yd. compactor with standard trash should be able to hold 6 tons comfortably. From the runs (cycles) of your compactor, things look normal on our end and we see your compactor being ran 30-40x per day. 

Is any other materials than just trash being put into the compactor? Are we sure its a 34 yd compactor? Is maintenance stating it is full or are residents leaving trash around the compactor?

I am just asking these questions to help diagnose it.

Thank you,
Chelsea

The compactor would not allow anymore trash in the phase II compactor.  Therefore, piles of trash were being left on the ground.  Maintenance tried to put it in but it would not compact any more.

Good Morning Lori!

Looks like the compactor got picked up at 3.84 tons yesterday. Typically a 34 yd. compactor with standard trash should be able to hold 6 tons comfortably. From the runs (cycles) of your compactor, things look normal on our end and we see your compactor being ran 30-40x per day. 

Is any other materials than just trash being put into the compactor? Are we sure its a 34 yd compactor? Is maintenance stating it is full or are residents leaving trash around the compactor?

I am just asking these questions to help diagnose it.

Thank you,
Chelsea

Hey there-That’s seems like a reasonable approach and you’d likely get a win-win with a switch to WM if there are any service changes that jump out with a 1st Pass review that may further cut costs.

Hi Jeff,

 

Please see the email chain below.

 

We spent time gathering bids, reaching out to multiple haulers, etc.  The property didn’t do anything with it and now are asking us to do it again four months later.

 

I think the fair thing to do is for me to confirm if WM will still honor the rates we quoted, considering they were the lower of the rates provided anyway, but I don’t think it is fair to go back to our vendor team and ask them to each out to other vendors again to confirm bids that likely wouldn’t be awarded to them.

 

Do you agree?

Sorry but it seems that this set of bids has fallen by the wayside. Would it be possible to request another set of bids? We are currently reviewing our trash disposal contract and would appreciate having some updated pricing. Also, the 30 yard open top container would not be necessary for this set of bids.

Hi Rebekah,

 

Our contract was actually for 2024.

We need a new one.

 

Are you able to send us a quote? If it makes sense financially to sign on with you, then we’d like to explore that option 

 

 

Thank you!

Hi Janelle,

 

They will resume services tomorrow.  Our team went ahead and paid December’s invoice to get the services reinstated.  I will have to dispute the charges you do not agree with in a separate task.

 

As for quotes, your agreement with them does not expire until 12/31.  Our quotes are only valid for 30 days.  I can put a note on my calendar to provide you a quote once we get closer to the termination of the agreement, otherwise, you would have to pay liquidated damages to South Shore for canceling early.

 

Thanks,

Pick-up days are Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays.

 

 

 

And while we’re on the topic, who can I reach out to to get a quote for a trash contract.

I’d love to get a quote from WM to be our trash vendor (rather than the middle man) if that’s an option that makes sense and fits our budget.

Hi Rebekah,

 

We did not request or approve any of the below bulk pick-ups. Perhaps residents manually dumped some items on their own.

 

Our trash pick up days are Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

 

Some of the dates below are a Tuesday and Thursday. Does this mean that someone called them out to pick up the bulk items?

 

The only thing we requested is for the Christmas trees. I’ve included my email with Neil and we were within the 2 week timeframe needed for a free pickup an dumpster rental

Got it, makes sense.

 

Yes, we did order Christmas tree bins, but were told there’d be no charge for those if picked up by a certain date….which they were.

 

I did not request bulk pickups or cleanouts, but if a resident dumped bulk items in the trash bins without us knowing, they may have charged us for that.

 

 

Anything to do with trash we’ll ensure we go through you regarding normal trash and/or bulk pickup.

Hi Janelle,

 

Our vendor payables team is working with them on the validation.  

 

It looks like you have had bulk cleanouts, bulk pickups, opentops for Christmas Trees.

 

We need all service requests to come through WM National Accounts, so that we can arrange them through South Shore Disposal.

Noted!

 

Do you know what the unrecognizable charge is? And are you able to reach out to me to get that confirmation?

Not sure if South Shore Disposal never received your email or call regarding the extra charge, but hopefully it’s something we can also answer

Hi Janelle,

 

Please make sure your onsite team calls us for all service requests. They should not be reaching out to Shore Disposal directly.  Anytime an invoice comes in with a charge we are not expecting, it delays the payment.  We have to reach out to the vendor to determine if it is an approved charge, who requested it, etc.  

 

This is the root cause of the delays in payment.

 

I’ve attached our customer service guide for you to share with your onsite team.  Page 2 has the top 20 requests, the information we need from you and who to contact.

 

We will arrange for CheckSammy or Got Junk to come clean up any trash off of the ground (excluding any bulk items).

 

Thanks,

Hi All,

 

Happy Monday! Today is Monday March 17th 2025

Our trash was not picked up due to unpaid invoices. This has happened several times in the past, the last time being November 2024.

 

1.	Is someone able to rectify this with South Shore Disposal today?

2.	Are you able to send someone out to pick up our trash? Right now all dumpsters are overflowing and there isn't space to collect new trash

 

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Unpaid Invoices-South Shore Disposal (The Cove)

 

Hi All,

 

We’ve received notice from our trash vendor that they have not received payment for their services. 

I’m not 100% sure how many invoices remain unpaid, but there are more than 1.

 

Neil, from South Shore Disposal, has reached out to WM for assistance with no luck.

 

Is someone able to assist in looking into their payment so as to not disrupt service?

 

I know this happened last year as well (see thread below).

 

Best,

Hello,

 

I have asked CheckSammy if they can send a team tomorrow (Thursday) anytime after 10 AM – I want to make sure staff is onsite and available to show them what needs to be removed.  They likely won’t confirm the scheduled time until later this evening, so I will send it over first thing tomorrow morning.  Janelle, if at all possible, can you send me a picture of the trash overflow?  I told them they’ll need to stop in the office so that staff can show them where to go, but having a photo would also help.

 

Thanks,

Hi Nathan,

 

I’m sorry if I wasn’t very clear before.  You have to use Republic at this property.  It is mandated by the City of Lewisville.  So whatever they quoted to you is what they are going to quote to us.

 

You do not have to use them for the compactor rental.  I would suggest that you go through the link I provided earlier in the email chain, that Greystar has set up for preferred equipment providers.  You’ll likely get a much better rental rate for the equipment.  You do have to use them for the service though.  You can either work with them directly or WM can work with Republic on your behalf, but any rates that they quote  for service will be based on the agreement they have with the City of Lewisville and is not negotiable.

 

It looks like for now, all they have quoted you for is the compactor, not the actual service.

 

Thanks,

Hi Rebekah,

 

I think the site walk with the team will help establish the best way to service this property. Our goal would be to manager the services through you as part of our national relationship.

 

If you could let us know the date of the visit the team will make sure they get all the questions below answered.

Thank you.

 

It appears from the map, the property intends to have a large compactor outside, along with offering recycling service.

 

I have a few more questions:

 

Do you intend for WM to manage the relationship between the property and Republic?

Will you have a valet/door to door service, picking up the trash from the tenants?

Have you already obtained the compactor?

If so, what size is it?  WM will need to know the size of the compactor to be able to set up services with Republic.

If not, please see the link and information below regarding ordering compactor equipment.  

When are move ins?

 

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins ( bins that connect to your chutes).

 

Its very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor Specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Good Morning,

 

We were notified that you called in, requesting a site visit to determine best services at this property.  Unfortunately, WM is unable to service this property.  It is in a Republic franchise area, which means you must use Republic for your services.

 

Are you wanting WM to set up services with Republic on your behalf?  If so, please provide us with the site plans so we can determine what services are needed.

 

Please note, for WM to manage the property, we would charge whatever Republic charges plus a $25.00/month management fee.

 

Thanks,

Obtaining an official acknowledgement and acceptance of the cancellation from WSS would be good. WM may ask for this before they proceed. If you can get a recent invoice from WSS, that would be helpful as part of the transition.

Of course- as long as there is a clean break from WSS, yes- that would pave the way to participate in the WM National program. Depending on how much margin the broker was working with, there could be a decent savings with the switch as well.

Of course- as long as there is a clean break from WSS, yes- that would pave the way to participate in the WM National program. Depending on how much margin the broker was working with, there could be a decent savings with the switch as well.

Hi Nathan- with only a few exceptions, we encourage participation in the WM National program. Between the Mighty90s credit and ongoing support that our team offers for cost and service level assessments, the value is often perceived as very high. 

 

You’re on the right path with Rebekah, she can handle the onboarding process.

Hi There,

 

With Jessica out I am just wondering if it is still preferred we use WM and have them source through Republic or just directly go through Republic?

Good Morning,

 

We were notified that you called in, requesting a site visit to determine best services at this property.  Unfortunately, WM is unable to service this property.  It is in a Republic franchise area, which means you must use Republic for your services.

 

Are you wanting WM to set up services with Republic on your behalf?  If so, please provide us with the site plans so we can determine what services are needed.

 

Please note, for WM to manage the property, we would charge whatever Republic charges plus a $25.00/month management fee.

 

Thanks,

Are you having issues?  I do not see any issues reported to our customer service department.  The last request was for a bulk pickup in March.

Ok, I am so sorry. I presented to the client and they were having a hard time swallowing a $83k/year increase. I think we will keep the compactor pick-ups the same (6x week) and just increase trash and recycling pick-ups by one day each. 

So I have to ask one last favor, can you provide pricing for the following?

Trash 4x/week

Recycle 5x/week

Hello there,

I have submitted the following quote for trash 

2–3-yard trash 5X per week

Reference 88704020

Please allow 2-3 business days to obtain the quote.

Compactor - we are currently at 6X per week @ $982.88, I don't understand why it costs $713.02 to add one day. Is it because Sunday costs extra?

The increase is due to adding an additional 21 yards per week = 84 additional yards per month

I will wait for your approval for the service increases before processing any changes.

Thank you

Trash - Yes, you had provided the cost for pick up 7 days a week. Since we are currently at 3 days, I am thinking 5 days a week would be meaningful enough to make a difference for us. What is the cost for 5 days a week?

Compactor - we are currently at 6X per week @ $982.88, I don't understand why it costs $713.02 to add one day. Is it because Sunday costs extra?

I will most likely get the recycle increase approved, just hold off until I get all over this approved. 🙂

We have a kick-off call with the client today. I'll add a note to ask for the acknowledgement and acceptance of the cancellation from WSS.

Obtaining an official acknowledgement and acceptance of the cancellation from WSS would be good. WM may ask for this before they proceed. If you can get a recent invoice from WSS, that would be helpful as part of the transition.

Of course- as long as there is a clean break from WSS, yes- that would pave the way to participate in the WM National program. Depending on how much margin the broker was working with, there could be a decent savings with the switch as well.

Sounds great, the recent invoice would be from WSS to help us benchmark costs when we take over. We can then compare to costs once we procure everything which are likely to be quite a bit lower.

Of course- as long as there is a clean break from WSS, yes- that would pave the way to participate in the WM National program. Depending on how much margin the broker was working with, there could be a decent savings with the switch as well.

 

Thanks,

Appreciate you reaching out - since the client is terminating the contract with WSS - this should make the process easier, right?!

Hi Crystal- I’m glad to answer any questions on how we manage through these situations for new assets. WSS is in fact a broker that has been challenging to work for different reasons I can share.

 

Please let me know how I can help!

Hi Rebekah – 

 

Can you please provide us with a bid for services with G/S national account pricing in place? Also, are there any recommendations for a change in service level considering the property has been operating without use of the compactors for some time? (…as I understand it…)

 

Also, if we were going to implement valet trash service and continue compactor use, what would that look like? We’d be happy to jump on a call with you to review options.

 

Information need is urgent here as we are finalizing the operating budget in short order.

 

Thanks!

Subject: Tree trash assessment

 

Hi Richard, hope all is well. 

 

Can you review the trash situation at Tree Apartments in Austin Tx and make recommendations for the owner?  This is a mid-rise wrap style building with trash shoots and a compactor.  Main concerns here are as follows?

 

*	Trash room is not large enough to accommodate the compactor and all the trash bins that are rolled out for pick up
*	When the trash bins are rolled out for pick up – the only place to put them is an area at the front entrance resulting in unsightly condition (see photos)
*	The trash bins that are rolled out are deteriorating and we think we own them – so how do we get new ones if we have to have these.
*	We use Waste Management for hauling
*	We have door to door valet with Valet Living
*	Also need to get compost according to City regulations and requirements since this has not been done here yet

 

Please let us know what you need and if you can stop by.  This is a valued client that we have been with for over 5 years in Austin and we have several properties with them here (3) and others in Phoenix and Portland.  Once you have recommendations, I would like to connect you with Dali Janc, the client.

 

Thank you,

Hi Alicia- I can certainly take a look at the property dynamics and help you determine the logic/ROI of converting to a compactor.

 

If you know what type and size compactor you’re wanting to get pricing on, feel free to go to the Greystar Waste Portal <https://greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal>  and click on the equipment tile (center, top row) to fill out the form, our Recommended Suppliers will be in touch within a day. 

 

We most always recommend going with a rental VS a purchase which we can talk through as well.

 

Thanks,

## Email Content

Hi Dawn/Rebekah- could you please take a look at this property’s service-- ownership is seeking options to streamline services and reduce costs. There have been instances of overage charges and currently our service team works to clean things up on Sundays which is not sustainable. 

 

*	There is a belief that moving 1 of the 5x/week service days to a Saturday pick up, would solve for a lot of the issues- can  you please confirm this is an option?

	*	Adding a 6th day of service is cost prohibitive for the trash collection

*	Yards and volume of service- it seems volume are within range for a garden style asset, can you please take a look and offer an opinion?
*	Price in general- seems to be an open market, is this property priced competitively?

If we can understand these items, it would be very helpful towards getting feedback to the client, we appreciate  your feedback!

 

Thanks

Jeff

Yes, those are the numbers I received. The owners of the building are asking if we can get a better deal if we use a different vendor. $156,167/year is a lot for trash/recycle service.

I think there may be confusion here on the pricing.  It appears as though you are calculating a monthly increase as a weekly increase, multiplying the increase by 52, rather than 12.

 

@Greystar Escalations <mailto:GreystarEscalations@wm.com>  please confirm the pricing below is what was quoted.

Hi Rebekah,

Sure, it is simply a pricing concern. I have started looking around for bids. We are looking to increase the frequency of trash and recycle pick ups by one day each and that is adding an additional expense of $23k/year for our client. This is all passed on to residents and we are already passing on huge utility bills to our residents so I am just concerned that Waste Management may not be the best choice for us anymore financially. 

 

CURRENT SERVICE

2–3-yard dumpster trash 3X per week (MWF) $607.22

1-3-yard trash compactor 6X per week (Mon thru Sat) $982.88

4-3-yard dumpster recycling 4X per week ( M-W-F-S) $959.48

 

PROPOSED SERVICE

2-3y trash 4x weekly = $ 834.66/ month

No change on compactor

4-3y recycling 5x weekly = $1185.68/month

 

 

Cost increase to approve:

Trash: $227.44

Compactor: 0

Recycle: $226.20/week

Total increase: $453.64/week    ($23,566/year)

Ok, I am so sorry. I presented to the client and they were having a hard time swallowing a $83k/year increase. I think we will keep the compactor pick-ups the same (6x week) and just increase trash and recycling pick-ups by one day each. 

So I have to ask one last favor, can you provide pricing for the following?

Trash 4x/week

Recycle 5x/week

Hello there,

I have submitted the following quote for trash 

2–3-yard trash 5X per week

Reference 88704020

Please allow 2-3 business days to obtain the quote.

Compactor - we are currently at 6X per week @ $982.88, I don't understand why it costs $713.02 to add one day. Is it because Sunday costs extra?

The increase is due to adding an additional 21 yards per week = 84 additional yards per month

I will wait for your approval for the service increases before processing any changes.

Trash - Yes, you had provided the cost for pick up 7 days a week. Since we are currently at 3 days, I am thinking 5 days a week would be meaningful enough to make a difference for us. What is the cost for 5 days a week?

Compactor - we are currently at 6X per week @ $982.88, I don't understand why it costs $713.02 to add one day. Is it because Sunday costs extra?

I will most likely get the recycle increase approved, just hold off until I get all over this approved. 🙂

Hi Shania

Trash: $834.86 Can we get a price for 5 days a week? ------

The current trash service is 

2–3-yard dumpster trash 3X per week (MWF) $607.22 are you wanting an additional quote for 5X per week. Is that correct?

Compactor: $713.02 why this much of an increase to add one more day?

Yes, the quote 1-3-yard trash compactor 7X per week (Mon-Sunday) $1695.90 is correct. That would be an additional 21 yards per week

Recycle: $452.36 Yes, we need this!

This is approved to increase, correct?

4-3-yard dumpster single stream recycling 6X per week ( Mon-Tues-Wed-Thursday-Friday-Sat) $1411.84

Please let me know.

Hi Alicia- I can certainly take a look at the property dynamics and help you determine the logic/ROI of converting to a compactor.

 

If you know what type and size compactor you’re wanting to get pricing on, feel free to go to the Greystar Waste Portal <https://greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal>  and click on the equipment tile (center, top row) to fill out the form, our Recommended Suppliers will be in touch within a day. 

 

We most always recommend going with a rental VS a purchase which we can talk through as well.

To whom it may concern,

My name is Katie Doster and I’m a Regional Property Manager with Greystar. I currently oversee four properties located in the Charleston area. Unfortunately, we are unable to utilize Waste Management services at these particular sites. However, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping ensure that we remain in compliance with our Mighty 90’s standards. Specifically, I’m reaching out to see if you may be able to assist with managing the billing and contracts for these properties under your existing support program. I’m preparing to go out on sabbatical leave, so I’ve also copied my Director, Mike Silky, on this email for visibility and ongoing coordination.

Attached, you’ll find the most recent invoices for all four properties to help get things started.

Thank you in advance for your support, and I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

Great, glad you have the contract. Our Advantage Solutions team can help us with a few things so we can feel good about the change. I understand the urgency but also want to make sure there are no hidden fees with compactor swaps and that they will utilize a 30-day cancellation per our contract.

Hi Jillian,

 

Unless WM can get us the pricing we want (which they can't based on the savings they provided us), CMK is going to require us to get give notice. Attached is the quote SBC provided. They got us closest to the target ($70/unit/year) CMK wants for 1400. SBC also promised to waive all recycling contamination fees. Something CMK stressed which WM refused.

 

I haven't received a contract from SBC yet because we don't have a commencement date. And we won't have a commencement date until I can confirm we can give notice to WM and for when. 

 

We are aligned regarding SBC needing to be on Greystar contract and compliant in Netvendor. 

 

CMK is expecting a quick resolution regarding this so I really can't afford to have this delay beyond today. I must know by the EOD today if we can give a 30-day notice with WM for all the CMK properties (Coeval, Imprint, Imprint Lofts, 1400, and Neveseno).

Hi Darian,

 

Prior to canceling any service with WM, we need to see the contract from SBC and what they are providing us so we can compare to our standards. They would need to sign our Greystar contract and go through a few other things to get approved so want to ensure we are doing the right thing. I’d like to avoid cancelling WM if possible.

 

Do you have a contract yet from SBC?

Could you please compare this to what rates WM could provide. I’ll address the compactor rental cost as well.

 

Thanks- I’ll hold off talking with Darian and Jillian until I hear back from you.

Hi Jillian,

 

Unless WM can get us the pricing we want (which they can't based on the savings they provided us), CMK is going to require us to get give notice. Attached is the quote SBC provided. They got us closest to the target ($70/unit/year) CMK wants for 1400. SBC also promised to waive all recycling contamination fees. Something CMK stressed which WM refused.

 

I haven't received a contract from SBC yet because we don't have a commencement date. And we won't have a commencement date until I can confirm we can give notice to WM and for when. 

 

We are aligned regarding SBC needing to be on Greystar contract and compliant in Netvendor. 

 

CMK is expecting a quick resolution regarding this so I really can't afford to have this delay beyond today. I must know by the EOD today if we can give a 30-day notice with WM for all the CMK properties (Coeval, Imprint, Imprint Lofts, 1400, and Neveseno).

Hi Darian,

 

Prior to canceling any service with WM, we need to see the contract from SBC and what they are providing us so we can compare to our standards. They would need to sign our Greystar contract and go through a few other things to get approved so want to ensure we are doing the right thing. I’d like to avoid cancelling WM if possible.

 

Do you have a contract yet from SBC?

Hi Jason- this is a good start and the most recent month of invoicing for each is needed along with a copy of the respective service agreements or contracts in place. The process takes about 30 days, so we’d be set up on or about Aug 1. 

 

Once I have those, I’ll loop you in with the WM team to begin the onboarding and ensure things go smoothly. If there are other waste related vendors (bulk removal, equipment rental, etc) that you want to include on the centralized invoice, please send the recent invoicing along as well.  To clarify, it’s a $25/mo fee. 

 

Thanks much,

Hi Crystal- if new compactor equipment is recommended, we have 2 National Recommended Suppliers that can provide quotes. We do not rely on WM for compactor equipment typically, it’s surprisingly a weak spot for them. 

 

Please let me know if we get a point of needing to get quotes and I’ll be sure to get you introduced to the appropriate folks!

	Hi!

	 

	Thanks for the information. I don’t think the bins are an issue as this is a mid-rise building and there are trash chutes on every floor. The maintenance team monitors the bins on the ground floor and rotates them as they fill up. My understanding is that the current ownership group has requested to have the compactors removed. Are you able to confirm this? Also, as we are working through decision-making on this, can you please advise what it would cost to re-install the compactors if they are, indeed removed at the seller’s request? If it’s very expensive, we may approach the seller about leaving them in place.

	Hi Suzanne,

	 

	Based on the current services, below are the Greystar rates.  I have asked Brittney to look at the property.  After she is able to look at the property, she can make recommendations on potential service changes.  It is always a red flag for me when there are compactors and bins on site.  Tenants will use the closest bin available to them all the time.  Compactors are the most cost-efficient service in most cases, but if you put a bin closer to them than the compactor, they will overload that bin and it will cost you more money in the long run.

Hi Jason- this is a good start and the most recent month of invoicing for each is needed along with a copy of the respective service agreements or contracts in place. The process takes about 30 days, so we’d be set up on or about Aug 1. 

 

Once I have those, I’ll loop you in with the WM team to begin the onboarding and ensure things go smoothly. If there are other waste related vendors (bulk removal, equipment rental, etc) that you want to include on the centralized invoice, please send the recent invoicing along as well.  To clarify, it’s a $25/mo fee. 

 

Thanks much,

Good morning Darian- we’ll get our plan in motion with optimizing services 1st, then look at pricing, then circle up and decide what the best move is. The signed contract will drive a lot of what WM needs to do or not and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to show some savings in the coming few weeks. I understand our client is stressing urgency. 

 

I’m not certain we want to have WM try to match SBC pricing- their proposed services seem off from what the property truly needs.

 

 

Thanks,

Hi Jeff,

 

I let the client know the details of the conversation we had last Friday and their response was that if we are stuck with Waste Management, they need to price match the quote that SBC sent to us (attached).

 

How do we go about this conversation with Waste Management? I already requested the removal of (2) loose trash bins there so that will help. But I believe we need to also reduce the pickup times from 5x per week to 7x per week. I just emailed them about this as well.

Hi Jillian,

 

Unless WM can get us the pricing we want (which they can't based on the savings they provided us), CMK is going to require us to get give notice. Attached is the quote SBC provided. They got us closest to the target ($70/unit/year) CMK wants for 1400. SBC also promised to waive all recycling contamination fees. Something CMK stressed which WM refused.

 

I haven't received a contract from SBC yet because we don't have a commencement date. And we won't have a commencement date until I can confirm we can give notice to WM and for when. 

 

We are aligned regarding SBC needing to be on Greystar contract and compliant in Netvendor. 

 

CMK is expecting a quick resolution regarding this so I really can't afford to have this delay beyond today. I must know by the EOD today if we can give a 30-day notice with WM for all the CMK properties (Coeval, Imprint, Imprint Lofts, 1400, and Neveseno).

Hi Darian,

 

Prior to canceling any service with WM, we need to see the contract from SBC and what they are providing us so we can compare to our standards. They would need to sign our Greystar contract and go through a few other things to get approved so want to ensure we are doing the right thing. I’d like to avoid cancelling WM if possible.

 

Do you have a contract yet from SBC?

Hi Jeff,

 

The client will likely want to go with SBC Waste Solutions (they are a local company).

Can you please confirm our notice period? They would like to have our WM contract end on 7/31/25.

Hello Jeff,

 

Typically with garden style we estimate ½ yard per door.  At 220 units, that means the recommendation for The Luxe would be 110 yards/week if fully occupied.  They’re currently only at 80 yards/week with (4) 4yd trash dumpsters 5x Week.

 

A lot of the overages seem to happen on Mondays, so updating the schedule to have Saturday one of the pickup days could alleviate the issue.  However, in this area Saturday service is extremely limited, and usually only offered with 6x Week service.  I’ve reached out to Operations to see if that is a firm requirement or if we could get approval to add Saturday and drop one of the days during the week.

 

Rebekah and I will review the pricing with the local team and let you know their feedback early next week.

 

Thanks,

Hi Dawn/Rebekah- could you please take a look at this property’s service-- ownership is seeking options to streamline services and reduce costs. There have been instances of overage charges and currently our service team works to clean things up on Sundays which is not sustainable. 

 

*	There is a belief that moving 1 of the 5x/week service days to a Saturday pick up, would solve for a lot of the issues- can  you please confirm this is an option?

	*	Adding a 6th day of service is cost prohibitive for the trash collection

*	Yards and volume of service- it seems volume are within range for a garden style asset, can you please take a look and offer an opinion?
*	Price in general- seems to be an open market, is this property priced competitively?

If we can understand these items, it would be very helpful towards getting feedback to the client, we appreciate  your feedback!

 

Thanks

Hi Alicia- I can certainly take a look at the property dynamics and help you determine the logic/ROI of converting to a compactor.

 

If you know what type and size compactor you’re wanting to get pricing on, feel free to go to the Greystar Waste Portal <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal__;!!DHXL-mcXkJmB!6YmM4Q67uws0wLb8b3AJ7vAZn9wYmsyAlYdlRBwYgDPjUdVXbQ4GbfcjntnwmCsCQDdtvUSxrkeH$>  and click on the equipment tile (center, top row) to fill out the form, our Recommended Suppliers will be in touch within a day. 

 

We most always recommend going with a rental VS a purchase which we can talk through as well.

My name is Katie Doster and I’m a Regional Property Manager with Greystar. I currently oversee four properties located in the Charleston area. Unfortunately, we are unable to utilize Waste Management services at these particular sites. However, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping ensure that we remain in compliance with our Mighty 90’s standards. Specifically, I’m reaching out to see if you may be able to assist with managing the billing and contracts for these properties under your existing support program. I’m preparing to go out on sabbatical leave, so I’ve also copied my Director, Mike Silky, on this email for visibility and ongoing coordination.

Attached, you’ll find the most recent invoices for all four properties to help get things started.

Thank you in advance for your support, and I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

Hi Josh- there are a few current activities underway with our door to door program.  When are you looking to make a change in providers? 

We do not have access to the old valet agreement but I imagine we can accomplish your objectives with or without that if I can get a bit more insight.

 

Thanks much,

Subject: Valet Living National Account - 2013

 

Hello Team,

 

We sent in a cancellation notice to Valet Living, and they are stating we are in a contract still. The original contract is from 2013, when they were our national preferred vendor.

 

Would you by chance have a copy of the national agreement between GS & Valet living from that time period? Or any notice of cancellation upon the time we notified them they would no longer be our preferred vendor?

 

Best,

Hi, 

 

I have a question regarding Emerson at Trace: the property pays WM but also must pay a City of San Marcos trash expense on the water bill, which I’m assuming is causing our non-compliance in Trash Hauling. Can this be recategorized as Franchise Market?

Hi Kyla- I see this property is on the WM National program which should include it into the M90s program for compliance.

To whom it may concern,

My name is Katie Doster and I’m a Regional Property Manager with Greystar. I currently oversee four properties located in the Charleston area. Unfortunately, we are unable to utilize Waste Management services at these particular sites. However, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping ensure that we remain in compliance with our Mighty 90’s standards. Specifically, I’m reaching out to see if you may be able to assist with managing the billing and contracts for these properties under your existing support program. I’m preparing to go out on sabbatical leave, so I’ve also copied my Director, Mike Silky, on this email for visibility and ongoing coordination.

Attached, you’ll find the most recent invoices for all four properties to help get things started.

Thank you in advance for your support, and I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

Hi Alicia- I can certainly take a look at the property dynamics and help you determine the logic/ROI of converting to a compactor.

 

If you know what type and size compactor you’re wanting to get pricing on, feel free to go to the Greystar Waste Portal <https://greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal>  and click on the equipment tile (center, top row) to fill out the form, our Recommended Suppliers will be in touch within a day. 

 

We most always recommend going with a rental VS a purchase which we can talk through as well.

 

Thanks,

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Alta Berry Creek (GRY000415) | Assistance Needed re: Billing Update

 

Good morning,

 

Our vendor team has reached back out to me, indicating that they are still having difficulty getting the City to update the billing address. 

 

At this time, the City does not believe Greystar has taken over the management for Wood Partners; they will not take the tax ID we have provided and will not take the LOA provided by your corporate office.  They have stated that they require a call from the Property directly in order to provide more details.  If you would like to stay on the WM National Accounts for Mighty 90's compliance, we are hoping that you can assist us in contacting the city to provide whatever information is needed for them to cooperate with us.  

 

Right now, the billing address on file is WOOD PARTNERS, 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN, TX 78633.  We need it updated to GREYSTAR ALTA BERRY CREEK GRY000415, PO BOX 589, WINDSOR CT 06095.

 

I had requested that our vendor team keep reaching out to the City for invoice copies until we actually began receiving them.  The last invoice received was the 5/19 invoice for April services.  When one of our agents contacted the City for the May and June invoices, he was informed that the account is current and there was no open balance, so he was unable to obtain those invoice copies.  

 

Chris, I know you indicated previously that Conservice was receiving invoices; however, they were the invoices that WM sends each month that reflect “Do Not Pay” on them, since payment is being made by your corporate office.  Is there any chance that Conservice actually is still paying invoices that they may be receiving directly from the City?  Would you be able to ask the City to confirm if they are sending invoices to multiple recipients, and then information on all payments received?   Below is the list of invoices that WM has paid, to date.  We do not have the invoices for May or June, since the City is saying that they have already been paid.

Hello Christopher,

 

We are continuing to work with the City to get the billing change completed.  They are now saying that they are unable to change the billing address until they have a copy of the property’s W-9 form for their records.  Part of the delay is because they still have this under Wood Partners.  They will only make the update if they receive the W-9 for your property under Greystar.  I’m looping in Jeff/Richard under @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  as well in case their assistance is needed.

 

Are you able to provide this ASAP?  

 

Thanks,

From talking to Conservice what billing they have received does have the wrong address on it. It has our property address and not the address for Conservice. Also, what they have received to date is very small amounts and I have attached a copy of one of the invoices. They say on them do not pay. They have not received anything for monthly billing as you would expect. I do not have access to the city billing portal as do not handle the processing here on site. I did ask Conservice if they do and they said they do not.

Good morning Chris,

 

I am terribly sorry for the delayed response.  Question – were you drafted from Conservice or paid them directly for January and February?

 

We are finally getting somewhere with the City of Georgetown.  They have sent over the April invoice, which appears to have a past due balance for March only.  Do you have access to the city billing portal by any chance?   If you have any way to access the invoices to send over to me, that would be a huge help.  If not, no worries – our vendor team is following up with the City daily asking for all unpaid invoices.  I am also following up with our team to ensure they are doing their due diligence to obtain them, and also confirm that the City has finally updated the billing address as they should have originally.

 

I will be sure to notify you when we have this matter resolved.

 

Thank you,

Hello Chris,

 

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  Our Vendor Management team has been reaching out to the City of Georgetown for outstanding invoices.  Are you able to confirm if you have received anything from them?  The remit address previously was WOOD PARTNERS 2201 SH 195, GEORGETOWN TX 78633. 

 

I have escalated this further, but if you did receive any invoices, please send them over ASAP.

 

Thanks,

I was given your email as our rep for our account. If this is correct thank you and if not can you possibly guide me in the direction of whom that might be.

I am assuming because of the holiday why no service yesterday and checking to see if that service will be today instead?

Hi Richard, hope all is well. 

Can you review the trash situation at Tree Apartments in Austin Tx and make recommendations for the owner? This is a mid-rise wrap style building with trash shoots and a compactor. Main concerns here are as follows?

*	Trash room is not large enough to accommodate the compactor and all the trash bins that are rolled out for pick up
*	When the trash bins are rolled out for pick up – the only place to put them is an area at the front entrance resulting in unsightly condition (see photos)
*	The trash bins that are rolled out are deteriorating and we think we own them – so how do we get new ones if we have to have these.
*	We use Waste Management for hauling
*	We have door to door valet with Valet Living
*	Also need to get compost according to City regulations and requirements since this has not been done here yet

Please let us know what you need and if you can stop by. This is a valued client that we have been with for over 5 years in Austin and we have several properties with them here (3) and others in Phoenix and Portland. Once you have recommendations, I would like to connect you with Dali Janc, the client.

Thank you,

Hi Kyla- I’ve copied Allison and Koffi who can likely answer this. 

 

We’ve seen several properties be out of compliance only due to timing of a change that was made recently. In those instances, we expect compliance to auto-correct on the next invoicing cycle at the and of July. Allison/Koffi can confirm if these 2 fall into that same category.

 

Thanks

My name is Katie Doster and I’m a Regional Property Manager with Greystar. I currently oversee four properties located in the Charleston area. Unfortunately, we are unable to utilize Waste Management services at these particular sites. However, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping ensure that we remain in compliance with our Mighty 90’s standards. Specifically, I’m reaching out to see if you may be able to assist with managing the billing and contracts for these properties under your existing support program. I’m preparing to go out on sabbatical leave, so I’ve also copied my Director, Mike Silky, on this email for visibility and ongoing coordination.

Attached, you’ll find the most recent invoices for all four properties to help get things started.

Thank you in advance for your support, and I look forward to your guidance.

Hello Jeff,

 

Typically with garden style we estimate ½ yard per door.  At 220 units, that means the recommendation for The Luxe would be 110 yards/week if fully occupied.  They’re currently only at 80 yards/week with (4) 4yd trash dumpsters 5x Week.

 

A lot of the overages seem to happen on Mondays, so updating the schedule to have Saturday one of the pickup days could alleviate the issue.  However, in this area Saturday service is extremely limited, and usually only offered with 6x Week service.  I’ve reached out to Operations to see if that is a firm requirement or if we could get approval to add Saturday and drop one of the days during the week.

 

Rebekah and I will review the pricing with the local team and let you know their feedback early next week.

 

Thanks,

Hi Dawn/Rebekah- could you please take a look at this property’s service-- ownership is seeking options to streamline services and reduce costs. There have been instances of overage charges and currently our service team works to clean things up on Sundays which is not sustainable. 

 

*	There is a belief that moving 1 of the 5x/week service days to a Saturday pick up, would solve for a lot of the issues- can  you please confirm this is an option?

	*	Adding a 6th day of service is cost prohibitive for the trash collection

*	Yards and volume of service- it seems volume are within range for a garden style asset, can you please take a look and offer an opinion?
*	Price in general- seems to be an open market, is this property priced competitively?

If we can understand these items, it would be very helpful towards getting feedback to the client, we appreciate  your feedback!

 

Thanks

Jeff

Hi Alicia- I can certainly take a look at the property dynamics and help you determine the logic/ROI of converting to a compactor.

 

If you know what type and size compactor you’re wanting to get pricing on, feel free to go to the Greystar Waste Portal <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal__;!!DHXL-mcXkJmB!6YmM4Q67uws0wLb8b3AJ7vAZn9wYmsyAlYdlRBwYgDPjUdVXbQ4GbfcjntnwmCsCQDdtvUSxrkeH$>  and click on the equipment tile (center, top row) to fill out the form, our Recommended Suppliers will be in touch within a day. 

 

We most always recommend going with a rental VS a purchase which we can talk through as well.

Hi Jeff,

 

I let the client know the details of the conversation we had last Friday and their response was that if we are stuck with Waste Management, they need to price match the quote that SBC sent to us (attached).

 

How do we go about this conversation with Waste Management? I already requested the removal of (2) loose trash bins there so that will help. But I believe we need to also reduce the pickup times from 5x per week to 7x per week. I just emailed them about this as well.

@Darian Jackson <mailto:darian.jackson@greystar.com>  could you please request a boilerplate agreement from SBC, waste contracts will often have several ‘gotchas’ we’ll want to take a look at in terms of due diligence. 

 

Thanks

Great, glad you have the contract. Our Advantage Solutions team can help us with a few things so we can feel good about the change. I understand the urgency but also want to make sure there are no hidden fees with compactor swaps and that they will utilize a 30-day cancellation per our contract. 

 

@Jeff Tucker <mailto:jeff.tucker@greystar.com>  is a call set for today? Appreciate any help or insights here.

Hi Jillian,

 

Unless WM can get us the pricing we want (which they can't based on the savings they provided us), CMK is going to require us to get give notice. Attached is the quote SBC provided. They got us closest to the target ($70/unit/year) CMK wants for 1400. SBC also promised to waive all recycling contamination fees. Something CMK stressed which WM refused.

 

I haven't received a contract from SBC yet because we don't have a commencement date. And we won't have a commencement date until I can confirm we can give notice to WM and for when. 

 

We are aligned regarding SBC needing to be on Greystar contract and compliant in Netvendor. 

 

CMK is expecting a quick resolution regarding this so I really can't afford to have this delay beyond today. I must know by the EOD today if we can give a 30-day notice with WM for all the CMK properties (Coeval, Imprint, Imprint Lofts, 1400, and Neveseno).

Hi Darian,

 

Prior to canceling any service with WM, we need to see the contract from SBC and what they are providing us so we can compare to our standards. They would need to sign our Greystar contract and go through a few other things to get approved so want to ensure we are doing the right thing. I’d like to avoid cancelling WM if possible.

 

Do you have a contract yet from SBC?

Hi Jason- this is a good start and the most recent month of invoicing for each is needed along with a copy of the respective service agreements or contracts in place. The process takes about 30 days, so we’d be set up on or about Aug 1. 

 

Once I have those, I’ll loop you in with the WM team to begin the onboarding and ensure things go smoothly. If there are other waste related vendors (bulk removal, equipment rental, etc) that you want to include on the centralized invoice, please send the recent invoicing along as well.  To clarify, it’s a $25/mo fee. 

 

Thanks much,

To whom it may concern,

My name is Katie Doster and I’m a Regional Property Manager with Greystar. I currently oversee four properties located in the Charleston area. Unfortunately, we are unable to utilize Waste Management services at these particular sites. However, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping ensure that we remain in compliance with our Mighty 90’s standards. Specifically, I’m reaching out to see if you may be able to assist with managing the billing and contracts for these properties under your existing support program. I’m preparing to go out on sabbatical leave, so I’ve also copied my Director, Mike Silky, on this email for visibility and ongoing coordination.

Attached, you’ll find the most recent invoices for all four properties to help get things started.

Thank you in advance for your support, and I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

Hi Team! I’m reaching out to get a quote for a self-contained trash compactor—something similar to the one in the image I’ve attached. It’s for our property at 1500 Jackson Street in Dallas, TX, which is a 9-story mid-rise community.

We’re looking for a unit that can handle mixed/wet waste and includes:

*	A fully self-contained design (compactor and container in one)

*	Leak- and odor-control features

*	A rear load hopper

*	Casters or wheels for mobility (like the one pictured)

If you could send over pricing details (purchase or lease), lead time, and any specs or maintenance options, that’d be super helpful. Let me know if you need anything from my end—like current waste volume or hauler info.

Hello,

 

I’ve been notified that you requested a repair on your compactor.  Unfortunately, due to the repair situation that occurred last year where the repairs were made without prior authorization of the charges and ultimately the charges had to be credited, WM Compactor Solutions is not willing to provide any additional repair work at this property.

 

I am very sorry for this.  I’m including two emails to a local Houston repair company that may be able to help you.  Otherwise, I am also including your Advantage Waste Solutions team in case they have another company that could help with the repairs.

Hi Ray- thanks for the detail, if you go to the OneGreystar waste portal <https://greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal> , and click on the center tile, top row,  to complete the form our reps from Tower Compactor and Compactor Rentals of America (CRA) will be in touch with you to drill down on the exact unit to match your application.  They are our National Recommended Suppliers and make the overall process straightforward. 

 

The existing containers may not be able to be utilized once you convert to compactor bins, just an FYI. Not sure if we own those or they are the trash company’s. 

 

Most of our properties are going down the rental path, you’ll get quoted 1 monthly rate that covers freight, install, service, parts, repairs, etc for 5 years. 

 

Thanks much, I’m happy to be a resource for you to help guide or compare options!

Thank you, Sarah!

Hi Team! I’m reaching out to get a quote for a self-contained trash compactor—something similar to the one in the image I’ve attached. It’s for our property at 1500 Jackson Street in Dallas, TX, which is a 9-story mid-rise community.

We’re looking for a unit that can handle mixed/wet waste and includes:

*	A fully self-contained design (compactor and container in one)

*	Leak- and odor-control features

*	A rear load hopper

*	Casters or wheels for mobility (like the one pictured)

If you could send over pricing details (purchase or lease), lead time, and any specs or maintenance options, that’d be super helpful. Let me know if you need anything from my end—like current waste volume or hauler info.

 

 



 

All the best,

Hello,

 

I’ve been notified that you requested a repair on your compactor.  Unfortunately, due to the repair situation that occurred last year where the repairs were made without prior authorization of the charges and ultimately the charges had to be credited, WM Compactor Solutions is not willing to provide any additional repair work at this property.

 

I am very sorry for this.  I’m including two emails to a local Houston repair company that may be able to help you.  Otherwise, I am also including your Advantage Waste Solutions team in case they have another company that could help with the repairs.

With that in mind, I was hoping you could potentially take a look at 2 other properties I have in Sacramento – Westwood and Kensington. Are you able to see if we have any opportunity for savings at either of these communities?

Good Morning,

 

@Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  Manhel is with Greystar’s Construction team.  Can you assist in getting Manhel access to the Greystar portal to order compactor equipment?

 

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins ( bins that connect to your chutes).

 

Its very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor Specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Hi Jeff,

 

Thanks for all of your help on The Luxe with their trash concerns! It is so great that we will not only be getting the Saturday service, but also seeing $500+ savings each month.

 

With that in mind, I was hoping you could potentially take a look at 2 other properties I have in Sacramento – Westwood and Kensington. Are you able to see if we have any opportunity for savings at either of these communities?

Hi all, 

I apologize as I am not sure who can help us with answering this question for our client. Going forward, if you can provide me the contact that manages the input on the Conservice side and the waste management side that would be helpful too.   Because I nor Hillary do any input into Energy Star/Measurable for Jefferson (as that is done by Synergy/Waste Management through Greystar) I am reaching out so someone can provide an answer to the client's question.  BlackRock is indicating that the metrics for gas had decreased in 2024 by 79% and waste by 67% from 2023.  The pool heater was turned off mid-year 2023 so I can somewhat explain the decrease in gas usage year over year, but I cannot explain the decrease in waste, especially by that amount.

 

 

Below is a snip it of the our 12 month statement for utilities in 2023 and 2024 and the questions asked by our client

 

2023

 



 

2024

 



 

 

 

"Hi Hillary, 

 

See below for reduction metrics for the property. Can you confirm these metrics and help[ to explain the drivers for this decrease? For fuel, I am assuming this is partially due to heat of the pool being off.

 

Thanks,

Hi Hill 

 

See below for reduction metrics for the property. Can you confirm these metrics and help[ to explain the drivers for this decrease? For fuel, I am assuming this is partially due to heat of the pool being off.

 

Thanks,

Hi Betsy- we’ve seen similar issues and have been informed it’s likely a timing thing that should self-correct at the end of this month. If not, please let me know and we’ll trouble shoot it with you!

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

 

Thanks,

Hello Julian,

 

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

Thank you Crystal,

 

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.  

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

$335.00 lease

 

Above rates do not include any applicable taxes/fees.

 

Please let me know approval ASAP so that I can get the changes processed.  I will keep you updated on the ETA on the return of the 2yd compactor bin, and also the status on if we can get another 4yd provided.

 

Thanks,

Importance: High

 

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Hi Julian- I’m glad to help out and it’s important to ensure the new bins (and any swapping of bins) are compatible with the compactor unit. 

 

Thanks,

Good morning,

 

Just thought I would check back here to see if you had decided to obtain quotes through the Greystar vendor network for additional 4yd compactor bins?  I’ve looped in Jeff @Advantage Waste Solutions <mailto:waste@greystar.com>  in case you had any questions or needed assistance with that portal.

 

If you do order 4yd compactor bins through one of the Greystar suppliers, just please keep me updated on when the equipment has been ordered and delivered.  We could then remove the 2-2yd compactor bins and adjust our equipment lease accordingly.  We would also adjust the monthly services, since currently the property is paying to have 2-4yd and 1-2yd compactor bins emptied.  

 

If you are going to just keep the current bins for now, let me know that also.  I’ll update our records to show that that 2nd 2yd box provided temporarily is actually going to remain onsite.

 

Thanks,

Hello Julian,

 

I am being told that at this time, the local office just can’t locate any additional 4yd compactor bins.  The Sr. District Manager even reached out to various WM container yards in NC and couldn’t find another yard that had something comparable.  The only way they would be able to supply them is if another customer happens to cancel their service.  

 

I know you currently have 2-4yd compactor bins and 2-2yd compactor bins.  If you truly prefer the larger 4yd compactor bins vs. the 2yd compactor bins, it is recommended that you work with the suppliers offered through Greystar.  Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (the bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Hello Julian,

 

I didn’t forget about this!  Still playing catch up from vacation.

 

The local office had delivered that additional 2yd compactor bin as a temp solution, if I recall.  They never did follow up to say if they found another 4yd…and apparently when I set myself a reminder in Outlook, I somehow didn’t actually put a notification on it.  So I have this reoccurring appointment to follow up, but was never getting an actual ping reminder.  Geesh, talk about embarrassing.  So sorry about that, good thing you reached out. 😊  

 

I am just waiting for the local office to respond on the e-mail I (finally) sent to see if they had an update, and will let you know when I hear back!  Wanted to send a quick note so you know I did get this.  😊

We have located the 2yd compactor bin and it will be returned on Friday 3/28/2025.

 

Effective that date, services will be updated as outlined below.  The reference #s are T47039464 for the 2-4yd-2x Week and T47041081 for the 1-2yd-2x Week.

 

The container shop has agreed to work on locating another 4yd compactor bin!  They did warn (as I warned Julian) that it could take several weeks, or longer.  I have set a bi-weekly Wednesday reminder to check in with the shop for a status update.  Then I will also send you a note with their response, so you know I haven’t forgotten about this. 😊   My first check in will be on 4/9/25.  

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello again,

 

Per my conversation with Julian this morning, I am working to get the 2yd compactor bin returned ASAP.  I am still waiting for Operations to confirm which yard it was delivered to, in order to bring it back.

 

Once onsite, it will be placed on a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.

 

I am also working to increase your (2) 4yd compactor bins to a 2x Week Tuesday/Friday schedule.  I’ve put a courtesy pickup in for Friday 3/28, as the actual service change likely won’t be completed until 4/1/2025.

 

I’m waiting for additional feedback from the local area on if we can possibly source another 4yd compactor bin from another yard, or fabricate one to replace the 2yd compactor bin.  It could take several weeks or potentially months, if we are able to provide, but hopefully would be sooner vs. later.  If I am told that we would be able to supply it, I will provide regular check-ins on the ETA until that is completed.

 

Before any changes can be made, I wanted to supply the updated monthly rates for approval.  Crystal @'miramgr@greystar.com' <mailto:miramgr@greystar.com>  please advise ASAP with approval.

 

Current $550.00/month

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 1x Week (T) $215.00

$335.00 lease

 

Proposed $1,790.46/month

Trash (1) 2yd compactor bin 2x Week (TF) $400.23

Trash (2) 4yd compactor bins 2x Week (T) $1055.23

Subject: RE: Greystar - Mira GRY020220 | Trash Compactor Service 
Importance: High

 

Julian and Crystal,

 

At the end of February, Customer Service received a request that you wanted to increase your service to have all (3) of your trash compactor bins on schedule, but you wanted to have your smaller 2yd trash compactor bin removed, and replaced with a 4yd trash compactor bin.

 

Unfortunately, those compactor bins are specially fabricated to work with the machines.  We do not stock them, and do not know if/when we would have any additional 4yd to provide.  At the time that your property was onboarded, you received (2) 4yd trash bins and (1) 2yd trash bin, because that was all that we had available to work with your machine.

 

We are unable to provide a larger 4yd trash bin.  Our only option is to deliver back that smaller 2yd trash bin that I believe was removed back on 3/3 (if it was removed, can you confirm?).  We can put that on a schedule, and/or we can also increase the # of pickups you receive, but unfortunately we cannot provide any additional 4yd bins at this time.

 

If you do want additional compactor containers, another option would be to purchase or lease them from an alternate vendor.  

 

Greystar has established preferred supplier partners for compactor equipment that include discounted rates, expedited shipping, and pre-negotiated rates and terms.  This includes rentals and purchases for compactors and compactor bins (bins that connect to your chutes).

 

It’s very easy to request a bid: (The request form has all the needed compactor specs, service guarantees, and details in one place).

Please let me know ASAP if you do need the smaller 2yd compactor bin returned, and if you wanted me to adjust your service so that it is also on your schedule, or increase the pickup schedule on your (2) 4yd compactor bins (currently 1x Week on Tuesday), or make another service adjustment.  If you have any questions, let me know.

Good morning! 

 

Peak83 has been dealing with some inconsistent and lackluster service from waste management this past few months. I am not sure if this is the proper channel for support with trash issues, but worth a shot! 

 

Here are some incidents that we have had to date. I will try to keep this as brief as I can! 

 

1.	Missed collections, especially on Tuesdays. No communication or reason as to why
2.	Compactor is not be placed back into its housing after returning to the site. Most recent incident was last Tuesday 7/22. We were without a functioning compactor until this past Monday 7/28.The hauler refused to push the compactor back into place. There was trash that had fallen from the chute when they moved the compactor out. Normally, the driver will just pick up the few items and throw them in the compactor. For some reason the driver we had refused, and getting someone back out to get our compactor working was impossible. 
3.	I was required to get a roll off from another company – Apex Waste – so when we had somewhere to put trash. This is the second instance I have had to do this.
4.	The driver told my maintenance team that they were under the impression we were not using Waste Management anymore and stated that is why the service is not being performed accurately. This isn’t the case.
5.	Our residents pay for door to door trash service, and if we must cancel due to Waste Managements lack of attention to the property – we get a lot of complaints. 

 

I attached a photo of what our team came into on Monday. The trash had to be staged from door to door collection due to the compactor still not being placed into the housing after almost a week. 

 

I am hoping I can get some support getting in touch with a person who can actually help me from waste management. If any contacts or reps are available to help me, or maybe meet on site to explain our concerns, it would be so helpful. 

 

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you want to hop on a call to discuss.

HI Manhel,
I'm just jumping in here since Jeff is out, but we can get you an agreement very quickly.  We just need to get your request in.  Click this link below -  it will take you straight to a very basic request form where you can advise who our supplier partners need to connect with at the property.  You can select both Tower and CRA if you want two different bids.  The suppliers will reach out to you, or the contact provided very quickly and can provide a quote or agreement very expeditiously (usually within a few days).  If they need a site survey completed (can sometimes be avoided if you can provide them with pictures) they might need a bit longer to give you a contract to execute once they verify electrical and current dimensions.  Both our rental companies offer 45 day install guarantees from the date of signature on the agreement.  Rough MATH HERE... I'm thinking its around $675 for the apartment style compactor and 5 bins if everything is standard sized and 3 phase electrical.    The pricing is good but you do need to get a formal quote.  

https://greystarit.formstack.com/forms/waste_portal - This link is safe and how you initiate getting compactor bids from our suppliers.  Its an internal resource.  Both the suppliers are vetted national recommended supplier partners.

Hello,

I understand but I can’t wait that long to buy out this scope.

Are you saying we can’t execute an agreement until we get closer to that date?
If that is the case, I need to go another direction/vendor.

Thanks

Thanks Manhel- with it being that far out, I would not want to even ballpark the cost. The form takes 45 seconds to fill out and select Tower Compactors and Gary will reach out to you within 24hrs. It’s quick and easy.

Hi Marah,
Quick Questions -  This transition feels a bit different than usual, with pulling equipment on such short notice and not sharing the new client so WM has an opportunity to maintain the work.  Just wanted to see if I could get a few details to help me make sense of this one.

Yes, I can write you up a 30-day notice. Everything will need to be removed from the property as it is not transferring over to anyone at this time.

 

Effective date will be August 31st however we just want billed for the next 30 days and everything removed immediately. I am reaching out as I am working with the transitions team on this.

We are supposed to receive a 30-day notice.

 

Are you wanting to actually terminate the services?  If so, I will have to get a quote for removing the compactor that will be billed to Greystar.  If not, I need a contact for the new owner/manager.

 

I need to know the effective date of the change and it will be processed when we receive the official Notice of Termination from Greystar’s Property Transitions team.
